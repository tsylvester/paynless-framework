    "pipeline_context": "This Milestone Schema acts as the 'Middle Zoom' artifact, bridging the high-level Master Plan with low-level Implementation Checklists. It decomposes strategic milestones into discrete architectural work nodes. Each node defines a specific module's path, role, and the capabilities it provides to the system, ensuring that developers and automated agents have a clear blueprint for component integration and dependency resolution.",
    "selection_criteria": "The selection is focused on the **Dependency Frontier**. Milestone M1 (Foundation) has no dependencies and is selected for immediate architectural definition. Milestone M2 (NLP Engine) depends on M1 and is included in this batch to establish the core logic-to-data flow early in the lifecycle. Milestones M3 and M4 are deferred as their dependencies (M2) are currently [ ].",
