By creating a high-quality, browser-based version of a beloved classic, we eliminate the high friction of emulators (e.g., DOSBox) required to play the original. The low barrier to entry (no installation, no cost) makes it accessible to a wide audience, from original fans to new casual gamers. The 'same-seat' multiplayer feature directly serves the social, in-person gaming niche, which is a key differentiator from most online-only modern titles.\",\n        \"competitive_analysis\": \"Primary competitors include modern artillery games like 'ShellShock Live' (Steam) and the 'Worms' series. These are established, feature-rich titles but are not free and require installation on specific platforms. Our key advantages are instant accessibility via any modern web browser, zero cost, and nostalgic fidelity to the original 'Scorched Earth'. While numerous free, web-based clones exist, they often suffer from poor quality, incomplete features, and intrusive ads. This project will stand out through its completeness, polish, and modern quality-of-life features (e.g., themes, trajectory preview) without compromising the core classic experience.\",\n        \"user_problem_validation\": \"The core user problem is the lack of a convenient, feature-complete way to play 'Scorched Earth'. Fans of the original must navigate the technical hurdles of DOS emulation. Newer players interested in the genre are met with either paid titles or low-quality browser games. This project solves the problem by providing a 'one-click-to-play' definitive version that is faithful to the original while incorporating modern UX improvements, making it the most accessible and

Single Page Application (SPA) architecture using React and TypeScript. This aligns perfectly with the requirements for offline play, no user accounts, and simple deployment. The core game logic will be separated from the rendering layer to ensure maintainability. We will use a state management library (like Redux Toolkit or Zustand) to manage the complex game state (players, terrain, weapons, turn order). The game view itself will be rendered on an HTML5 `<canvas>` element for performance, leveraging a library like Pixi.js or Konva for hardware-accelerated 2D graphics, which is ideal for handling dynamic terrain destruction and many particle effects.\",\n        \"components\": \"Key technical components will include: 1) **Game Engine**: Manages the main game loop (`requestAnimationFrame`), turn sequencing, and calls to other systems. 2) **Physics Engine**: A custom, simple physics module to handle projectile motion (parabolic arcs influenced by power, angle, wind, and gravity) and collision detection. 3) **Terrain System**: A module for procedurally generating the terrain (e.g., using simplex noise) and, crucially, modifying its data structure in real-time to reflect destruction from explosions. This will likely be represented as a heightmap array. 4) **Rendering Engine**: Responsible for drawing the terrain, tanks, projectiles, explosions, and UI onto the canvas. 5) **AI Controller**: A module that calculates shots for computer-controlled players, with varying difficulty levels influencing accuracy and weapon choice. 6) **State Manager**: The single source of truth for the application state.\",\n        \"data\": \"All game data will be managed in-memory on the client.
