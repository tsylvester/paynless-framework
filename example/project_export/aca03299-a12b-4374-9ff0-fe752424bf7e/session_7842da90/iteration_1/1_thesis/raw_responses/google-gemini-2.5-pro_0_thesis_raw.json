By creating a high-quality, browser-based version of a beloved classic, we eliminate the high friction of emulators (e.g., DOSBox) required to play the original. The low barrier to entry (no installation, no cost) makes it accessible to a wide audience, from original fans to new casual gamers. The 'same-seat' multiplayer feature directly serves the social, in-person gaming niche, which is a key differentiator from most online-only modern titles.\",\n        \"competitive_analysis\": \"Primary competitors include modern artillery games like 'ShellShock Live' (Steam) and the 'Worms' series. These are established, feature-rich titles but are not free and require installation on specific platforms. Our key advantages are instant accessibility via any modern web browser, zero cost, and nostalgic fidelity to the original 'Scorched Earth'. While numerous free, web-based clones exist, they often suffer from poor quality, incomplete features, and intrusive ads. This project will stand out through its completeness, polish, and modern quality-of-life features (e.g., themes, trajectory preview) without compromising the core classic experience.\",\n        \"user_problem_validation\": \"The core user problem is the lack of a convenient, feature-complete way to play 'Scorched Earth'. Fans of the original must navigate the technical hurdles of DOS emulation. Newer players interested in the genre are met with either paid titles or low-quality browser games. This project solves the problem by providing a 'one-click-to-play' definitive version that is faithful to the original while incorporating modern UX improvements, making it the most accessible and enjoyable way to experience the classic artillery game.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"key\": \"mvp_feature_spec_with_user_stories\",\n      \"template_filename\":
