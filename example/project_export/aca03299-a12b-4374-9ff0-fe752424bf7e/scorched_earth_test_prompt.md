Build an in-browser js/ts/react version of Scorched Earth that supports single player with a selectable number of computer-managed opponents, and same-seat multiplayer for additional human players (plus a selectable number of computer opponents). Accommodate up to 8 players total.

Ensure all game weapons and modes from the original game exist as described in the document. Complete all weapons and modes, do not leave any work unfinished. The game will be almost an exact clone, but we will update it with a few modern touches.

Provide an in-game restart button so players can restart with the same game options from within the game. When the player restarts the game, reset the terrain and all the PC and NPC positions

Provide a terrain slider so that the user can select how aggressive the terrain is, where the slider fully to the left creates gentle terrain and the slider full to the right creates very complex terrain. The middle of the slider should be the standard Scorched Earth mountainous experience.

Ensure all weapons are usable by players. Instead of letting players purchase weapons between rounds, create an interaction mode so players can purchase weapons at any time if they have the budget. A dropdown button would be fine for that.

Do not create logins or accounts, use random anonymous players with generated names. If possible, the game should be all client side so that once itâ€™s loaded the player can turn off their network and continue playing the game indefinitely without closing it.

Make it beautiful and include all the options, weapons, and abilities from Scorched Earth while looking modern, clean, performative, using current web standards. Implement dynamic terrain destruction and vehicle movement like the original.

Create a trajectory view switcher so that users can see the anticipated firing solution if they wish.

Keep graphics primitive, but let the player switch between light mode, dark mode, vaporwave, cyberpunk, and original. Use relevant color choices for each theme.

The game will consist of three rounds, the rounds are won when only one player remains, or when all player-character vehicles are destroyed.

A few items to be careful of:

1) Ensure vehicles can fire their artillery and respond to artillery fire by taking damage.

2) Ensure vehicles can use their fuel to move their vehicle. Going uphill takes more fuel than going downhill.

3) Ensure the vehicle firing trajectory is from -90 to +90 on the graph.

4) Ensure the vehicle turret is the origin of their fire and the origin of the trajectory for the fire solution.

5) Ensure the fire power slider provides enough fire power that at the minimum the vehicle is clear of its own artillery blast radius, and at the maximum the vehicle can fire across 3/4 of the map without wind support and without moving.
