Each milestone includes essential fields such as ID, title, objective, dependencies, acceptance criteria, inputs, outputs, and status, ensuring consistency and clarity across the project plan. This schema is critical for enabling iterative development, facilitating automated tracking, and providing a clear understanding of project progress and dependencies to all stakeholders. It is designed to be robust yet flexible, allowing for future expansion while maintaining core validation rules."
