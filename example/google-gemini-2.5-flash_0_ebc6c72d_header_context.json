    "executive_summary": "This `HeaderContext` provides the foundational strategic and technical planning for a new web-based personal productivity application. It outlines the core user objective for a unified notepad, to-do list, reminders, and event scheduling app. The document suite includes a comprehensive business case establishing market fit and risks, a detailed feature specification breaking down user requirements into actionable stories and acceptance criteria, a robust technical approach covering architecture, components, and deployment using Next.js, TypeScript, and Shadcn, and a strategic success metrics plan to guide development and monitor adoption. This initial baseline leverages modern web standards and proven frameworks to ensure a secure, maintainable, and scalable solution, aligning with the project's ambition to offer an integrated and user-friendly experience.",
    "input_artifacts_summary": "The user objective is to develop a web application functioning as a comprehensive personal productivity tool. Key features include a notepad for general notes, a to-do list with due dates and completion tracking, event scheduling, and a robust reminder system for both tasks and events. The application should greet the user with 'Hello World', display the current date, and list tasks and notes upon loading. It requires user accounts and is to be built using TypeScript, Next.js, and Shadcn UI components.",
    "stage_rationale": "As a senior product strategist and technical architect, the goal in this initial stage is to establish a comprehensive baseline that addresses both the 'what' (product strategy) and 'how' (technical architecture) of the user's objective. This involves identifying core business value, detailing user-facing features, defining a feasible and scalable technical stack, and establishing clear metrics for success. The chosen approach leverages modern, well-understood web standards (Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn) which minimize risk and time-to-market while offering superior developer experience and performance, aligning with the preference for standards when they meet constraints and minimize risk. Distinct perspectives are integrated by providing both the product-centric 'Business Case' and 'Feature Spec' alongside the engineering-focused 'Technical Approach' and the data-driven 'Success Metrics', ensuring a holistic understanding from the outset. This setup facilitates rapid prototyping, secure development practices, and prepares for future scalability, satisfying the stage instructions for establishing a comprehensive baseline and recommending common approaches with clear benefit-cost profiles.",

Users often rely on a fragmented set of applications (separate note-taking, task managers, calendars), leading to context switching and inefficiencies. A unified web-based application offers significant market potential for users seeking a streamlined, all-in-one solution.",

Some offer limited integrations, but none fully integrate all user requirements into a single, cohesive, modern web experience with the specified technology stack. Niche apps exist, but often lack the breadth or user experience of a unified solution.",
