# Implementation Plan: AuthRequiredError Handling Cleanup (20250424174735)

## Goal

Refactor the handling of authentication errors (`401 Unauthorized`) originating from API calls to ensure clear separation of concerns, eliminate duplicate logic (especially pending action saving), and improve code clarity, maintainability, and testability.

## Core Principles

1.  **Single Responsibility:** Each component (`apiClient`, API wrappers, Stores) should have a distinct role.
2.  **No Duplication:** Logic like saving pending actions should exist in only one place.
3.  **Clear Signaling:** `apiClient` should clearly signal *when* authentication is required, and Stores should handle the *application-level consequences*.

## TDD Checklist

**Phase 1: Refactor `apiClient.ts`**

*   [X] **Modify `apiClient.ts` (`request` method):**
    *   [X] Locate the `catch` block (~line 152).
    *   [X] **Remove** the logic within the `if (error instanceof AuthRequiredError || ...)` block that saves the pending action to `localStorage` (~lines 155-164).
    *   [X] Ensure the `catch` block still correctly re-throws the `AuthRequiredError` if caught (~line 170).
    *   [X] Locate the primary 401 check within the `try` block (~line 117).
    *   [X] Ensure this `if` condition **only** throws `AuthRequiredError` if `response.status === 401`, `!options.isPublic` is true, AND the parsed `responseData` contains `code: 'AUTH_REQUIRED'`. (Reinstate the stricter check).
*   [X] **Test:**
    *   [X] Run relevant `apiClient.test.ts` tests specifically focusing on 401 handling.
        *   `pnpm --filter @paynless/api-client test -- -t "should THROW AuthRequiredError.*on 401 with code AUTH_REQUIRED"` (Expect FAIL - Now correctly throws error, but test expects localStorage which was removed)
        *   `pnpm --filter @paynless/api-client test -- -t "should return ApiResponse with standard error for 401 WITHOUT code AUTH_REQUIRED"` (Expect PASS - Passed)
        *   `pnpm --filter @paynless/api-client test -- -t "should NOT throw AuthRequiredError for public routes on 401"` (Expect PASS - Passed)
    *   [ ] Fix any failing tests related to the changes. Tests should *not* expect `localStorage` interaction from `apiClient` for 401s anymore. (Deferred - Failures understood)
*   [X] **Build:** Run `pnpm build`. Fix any build errors. (Completed)
*   [X] **Prove:** Manually test the application flow where a 401 *without* the `AUTH_REQUIRED` code might occur (if possible to simulate). Verify it doesn't trigger the login redirect inappropriately. Test the flow where a 401 *with* the code *should* occur (like sending a chat message while logged out) - **this flow is expected to be broken at this stage** as the `aiStore` hasn't been updated yet. (Completed - Behavior confirmed)
*   [ ] **Commit:** Commit changes with message: `refactor(api-client): Isolate AuthRequiredError signaling and remove pending action logic`.
*   [X] **Continue:** Proceed to Phase 2.

**Phase 2: Refactor `aiStore.ts`**

*   [X] **Modify `aiStore.ts` (`sendMessage` method):**
    *   [X] Locate the `catch (err: any)` block (~line 164).
    *   [X] Verify the `if (err instanceof AuthRequiredError || err?.name === 'AuthRequiredError')` check exists and handles the specific error. (Corrected/verified)
    *   [X] Ensure the logic *inside* this block correctly:
        *   [X] Constructs the `pendingAction` object based on `requestData`.
        *   [X] Saves the `pendingAction` to `localStorage`. **This is now the single source of truth for saving pending chat actions.**
        *   [X] Calls `navigate('login')`.
        *   [X] Cleans up optimistic UI updates (removes temp user message).
        *   [X] Sets `aiError` state to `null`.
    *   [X] Review the logic *outside* the `AuthRequiredError` check (the `else` part of the `catch`, and the subsequent state updates). Ensure it correctly handles *other* errors (generic errors thrown from the `try` block if `response.error` was present) by setting the `aiError` state and cleaning up optimistic UI. (Verified)
*   [X] **Test:**
    *   [X] Run relevant `aiStore.test.ts` tests. (`aiStore.sendMessage.test.ts` passed)
        *   [X] Focus on tests for `sendMessage`.
        *   [X] Mock `api.ai().sendChatMessage` to throw `AuthRequiredError`. Verify `localStorage.setItem` and `navigate` are called, and the final state is correct (no AI error message). (Verified by tests)
        *   [X] Mock `api.ai().sendChatMessage` to return `ApiResponse` with `status: 400` and an `error` object. Verify `localStorage` and `navigate` are *not* called, the `aiError` state is set, and optimistic updates are reverted. (Verified by tests)
        *   [X] Mock `api.ai().sendChatMessage` to return `ApiResponse` with `status: 200` and `data`. Verify state updates correctly. (Verified by tests)
    *   [X] Add or modify tests to cover these specific scenarios if they don't exist. (Existing tests covered scenarios)
*   [X] **Build:** Run `pnpm build`. Fix any build errors. (Completed)
*   [X] **Prove:**
    *   [X] **Crucially, test the logged-out chat flow:**
        *   [X] Log out.
        *   [X] Attempt to send a chat message.
        *   [X] Verify you are correctly redirected to the login page.
        *   [X] Verify the `pendingAction` for the chat message is correctly stored in `localStorage`.
    *   [X] Log back in.
    *   [X] Verify the pending chat action is replayed successfully (message sent, response received).
    *   [X] Test sending messages while logged in - verify normal operation.
        *   [X] Manually simulate (if possible via network tools) or ensure tests cover API returning other errors (like 400/500) and verify the UI shows the error message correctly without redirecting.
*   [X] **Commit:** Commit changes with message: `refactor(aiStore): Centralize AuthRequiredError handling and pending action logic`. (Includes fix for default navigation on SIGNED_IN)
*   [X] **Continue:** Review Stripe test failures.

**Phase 3: Address Stripe Test Failures & Final Review**

*   [X] **Review Stripe Tests:**
    *   [X] Run the failing Stripe tests in `packages/api-client/src/stripe.api.test.ts` again (`pnpm --filter @paynless/api-client test -- -t "StripeApiClient"`). (Tests are now PASSING, issue seems resolved)
    *   [ ] Analyze the failures (still expecting 401 but getting 500). These seem unrelated to the `AuthRequiredError` refactor but were previously masked or are interacting with other changes. (N/A - Tests passing)
    *   [ ] Investigate the mock server handlers (`msw`) or the test setup for these specific Stripe 401 scenarios. Ensure the mocks are correctly configured to return 401 when expected. It's possible the test setup needs adjustment based on how `apiClient` now handles tokens or headers after recent changes. (N/A - Tests passing)
    *   [ ] Fix the Stripe tests. (N/A - Tests passing)
*   [ ] **Fix `apiClient` Tests:**
    *   [ ] Locate the 4 failing tests in `packages/api-client/src/apiClient.test.ts` (related to GET/POST/PUT/DELETE throwing AuthRequiredError).
    *   [ ] Remove the expectation/assertion that `localStorage.setItem` is called within these tests.
    *   [ ] Ensure the tests still correctly assert that `AuthRequiredError` is thrown.
*   [ ] **Test:** Run the full test suite (`pnpm test`). Ensure all tests pass, including the previously skipped `aiStore.replay.test.ts` if the `localStorage` issues were related or can now be addressed.
*   [ ] **Build:** Run `pnpm build`.
*   [ ] **Prove:** Perform final regression testing on authentication flows, chat functionality (logged in and logged out), and any related areas like Stripe interactions if relevant.
*   [ ] **Commit:** Commit final test fixes and any related changes: `fix(tests): Correct Stripe API client tests and ensure full suite passes`.

**Phase 4: Documentation & Follow-up**

*   [ ] Update this implementation plan, marking steps as complete.
*   [ ] Update `STRUCTURE.md`, `DEV_PLAN.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` if architectural changes warrant it.
*   [ ] Consider creating follow-up tasks identified during refactoring (e.g., investigating original missing auth header if it persists unexpectedly).
*   [ ] Merge changes.
