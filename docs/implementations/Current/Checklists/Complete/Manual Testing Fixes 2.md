# Manual Testing Fixes: Fixes discovered from testing the dialectic user flow. 

##Problem Statement
The dialectic user flow has been revised significantly through the Model Call Refinement, Prompt Construction Repair, and Job Continuation Repair work plans. Now the process needs to be end to end tested and validated. 

##Objectives 
The objective is to validate and prove that the entire dialectic work flow works correctly for users from the start of a dialectic project to its end. 

##Expected Outcome
A complete, error free user experience. 

## Instructions for Agent
*   You MUST read the file every time you need to touch it. YOU CAN NOT RELY ON YOUR "MEMORY" of having read a file at some point previously. YOU MUST READ THE FILE FROM DISK EVERY TIME! 
*   You MUST read the file BEFORE YOU TRY TO EDIT IT. Your edit WILL NOT APPLY if you do not read the file. 
*   To edit a file, READ the file so you have its state. EDIT the file precisely, ONLY changing EXACTLY what needs modified and nothing else. Then READ the file to ensure the change applied. 
*   DO NOT rewrite files or refactor functions unless explicitly instructed to. 
*   DO NOT write to a file you aren't explicitly instructed to edit. 
*   We use strict explicit typing everywhere, always. 
    * There are only two exceptions: 
        * We cannot strictly type Supabase clients
        * When we test graceful error handling, we often need to pass in malformed objects that must be typecast to pass linting to permit testing of improperly shaped objects. 
*   We only edit a SINGLE FILE at a time. We NEVER edit multiple files in one turn.
*   We do EXACTLY what the instruction in the checklist step says without exception.
*   If we cannot perform the step as described or make a discovery, we explain the problem or discovery and HALT! We DO NOT CONTINUE after we encounter a problem or a discovery.
*   We DO NOT CONTINUE if we encounter a problem or make a discovery. We explain the problem or discovery then halt for user input. 
*   If our discovery is that more files need to be edited, instead of editing a file, we generate a proposal for a checklist of instructions to insert into the work plan that explains everything required to update the codebase so that the invalid step can be resolved. 
*   DO NOT RUMINATE ON HOW TO SOLVE A PROBLEM OR DISCOVERY WHILE ONLY EDITING ONE FILE! That is a DISCOVERY that requires that you EXPLAIN your discovery, PROPOSE a solution, and HALT! 
*   We always use test-driven-development. 
    *   We write a RED test that we expect to fail to prove the flaw or incomplete code. 
        *   A RED test is written to the INTENDED SUCCESS STATE so that it is NOT edited again. Do NOT refer to "RED: x condition now, y condition later", which forces the test to be edited after the GREEN step. Do NOT title the test to include any reference to RED/GREEN. Tests are stateless. 
        *   We implement the edit to a SINGLE FILE to enable the GREEN state.
        *   We run the test again and prove it passes. We DO NOT edit the test unless we discover the test is itself flawed. 
*   EVERY EDIT is performed using TDD. We DO NOT EDIT ANY FILE WITHOUT A TEST. 
    *   Documents, types, and interfaces cannot be tested, so are exempt. 
*   Every edit is documented in the checklist of instructions that describe the required edits. 
*   Whenever we discover an edit must be made that is not documented in the checklist of instructions, we EXPLAIN the discovery, PROPOSE an insertion into the instruction set that describes the required work, and HALT. 
    *   We build dependency ordered instructions so that the dependencies are built, tested, and working before the consumers of the dependency. 
*   We use dependency injection for EVERY FILE. 
*   We build adapters and interfaces for EVERY FUNCTION.  
*   We edit files from the lowest dependency on the tree up to the top so that our tests can be run at every step.
*   We PROVE tests pass before we move to the next file. We NEVER proceed without explicit demonstration that the tests pass. 
*   The tests PROVE the functional gap, PROVE the flaw in the function, and prevent regression by ensuring that any changes MUST comply with the proof. 
*   Our process to edit a file is: 
    *   READ the instruction for the step, and read every file referenced by the instruction or step, or implicit by the instruction or step (like types and interfaces).
    *   ANALYZE the difference between the state of the file and the state described by the instructions in the step.
    *   EXPLAIN how the file must be edited to transform it from its current state into the state described by the instructions in the step. 
    *   PROPOSE an edit to the file that will accomplish the transformation while preserving strict explicit typing. 
    *   LINT! After editing the file, run your linter and fix all linter errors that are fixable within that single file. 
    *   HALT! After editing ONE file and ensuring it passes linting, HALT! DO NOT CONTINUE! 
*   The agent NEVER runs tests. 
*   The agent uses ITS OWN TOOLS. 
*   The agent DOES NOT USE THE USER'S TERMINAL. 

## Legend

*   `[ ]` 1. Unstarted work step. Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference. We begin with 1.
    *   `[ ]` 1.a. Work steps will be nested as shown. Substeps use characters, as is typical with legal documents.
        *   `[ ]` 1. a. i. Nesting can be as deep as logically required, using roman numerals, according to standard legal document numbering processes.
*   `[‚úÖ]` Represents a completed step or nested set.
*   `[üöß]` Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set.
*   `[‚è∏Ô∏è]` Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking or further clarification.
*   `[‚ùì]` Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing.
*   `[üö´]` Represents a blocked, halted, or stopped step or has an unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing.

## Component Types and Labels

The implementation plan uses the following labels to categorize work steps:

*   `[DB]` Database Schema Change (Migration)
*   `[RLS]` Row-Level Security Policy
*   `[BE]` Backend Logic (Edge Function / RLS / Helpers / Seed Data)
*   `[API]` API Client Library (`@paynless/api` - includes interface definition in `interface.ts`, implementation in `adapter.ts`, and mocks in `mocks.ts`)
*   `[STORE]` State Management (`@paynless/store` - includes interface definition, actions, reducers/slices, selectors, and mocks)
*   `[UI]` Frontend Component (e.g., in `apps/web`, following component structure rules)
*   `[CLI]` Command Line Interface component/feature
*   `[IDE]` IDE Plugin component/feature
*   `[TEST-UNIT]` Unit Test Implementation/Update
*   `[TEST-INT]` Integration Test Implementation/Update (API-Backend, Store-Component, RLS)
*   `[TEST-E2E]` End-to-End Test Implementation/Update
*   `[DOCS]` Documentation Update (READMEs, API docs, user guides)
*   `[REFACTOR]` Code Refactoring Step
*   `[PROMPT]` System Prompt Engineering/Management
*   `[CONFIG]` Configuration changes (e.g., environment variables, service configurations)
*   `[COMMIT]` Checkpoint for Git Commit (aligns with "feat:", "test:", "fix:", "docs:", "refactor:" conventions)
*   `[DEPLOY]` Checkpoint for Deployment consideration after a major phase or feature set is complete and tested.

## TDD Checklist (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR): Dialectic Chat Payload Fix

- [‚úÖ] 77.a. RED: Stripe adapter import path resolution
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/adapters/stripe/stripePaymentAdapter.ts` (new minimal import test colocated)
  - Add a test that imports the adapter to force type-check resolution of its internal imports; expect failure due to incorrect relative path to `payment.types.ts` reported during serve.

- [‚úÖ] 77.b. GREEN: Fix Stripe adapter import path
  - [BE]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/adapters/stripe/stripePaymentAdapter.ts`
  - Update the import of payment types from `../../types/payment.types.ts` to `../../../types/payment.types.ts` so the module resolves under `_shared/ai_service` structure.

- [ ] 78.a. RED: Enqueue job requires wallet for manual flow
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/generateContributions.test.ts` (or closest entry where jobs are created)
  - Create a case that constructs a job payload without `walletId` for a manual test run; assert the flow fails early with a clear error and no provider call.

- [‚úÖ] 78.b. GREEN: Provide walletId in manual/test job creation
  - [BE]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/generateContributions.ts`
  - Implemented upfront validation: if `payload.walletId` is missing/blank, return `{ success: false, error: { message: "walletId is required to create generation jobs.", status: 400 } }` before any DB calls.
  - Rationale: prevents bad jobs from being enqueued; complements positive plumbing from UI/Store.

- [ ] 78.c. REFACTOR: Document manual testing wallet requirement
  - [DOCS]
  - **File**: `docs/implementations/Current/Checklists/Current/Manual Testing Fixes.md`
  - Add a short note in the manual testing section indicating that `walletId` must be provided when creating jobs locally; otherwise the worker path will reject the call during preflight.

- [‚úÖ] 78.d. STORE: Enrich generateContributions payload with active walletId
  - [STORE]
  - **File**: `packages/store/src/dialecticStore.ts`
  - Before calling `api.dialectic().generateContributions(payload)`, derive the active wallet via `selectActiveChatWalletInfo(useWalletStore.getState())` and set `payload.walletId = active.walletId`.
  - Add unit tests to prove `walletId` is included for both personal and org contexts.

- [‚úÖ] 78.e. UI: Gate Generate button on wallet readiness and thread walletId
  - [UI]
  - **File**: `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/GenerateContributionButton.tsx`
  - Ensure button remains disabled until chat context selection is valid and an active wallet is available.
  - Build payload to include `walletId` from the same store selector used by chat (or via a tiny store helper), keeping DI minimal in the component.

- [‚úÖ] 78.f. REFACTOR: Fix wallet selector reactivity
  - [STORE] [REFACTOR]
  - **Problem**: `selectActiveChatWalletInfo` uses a non-reactive `useAiStore.getState()` call, preventing components that use it from updating when the chat context changes.
  - **Objective**: Refactor the selector and its consumer components to be fully reactive to changes in `aiStore.newChatContext`.

- [‚úÖ] 78.f.i. RED: Prove selector reacts to context changes
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `packages/store/src/walletStore.selectors.test.ts`
  - Add a test that asserts the desired final behavior:
    - Mock `aiStore` to return a `newChatContext` of `'personal'`.
    - Call `selectActiveChatWalletInfo` with the wallet state and store the result.
    - Update the `aiStore` mock to return a `newChatContext` for an organization.
    - Call `selectActiveChatWalletInfo` again and assert that the output **changes** to reflect the organizational wallet.
  - **Expected**: This test will FAIL (RED) because the selector currently ignores changes in the `aiStore`.

- [‚úÖ] 78.f.ii. GREEN: Refactor selector and update its tests
  - [STORE]
  - **File**: `packages/store/src/walletStore.selectors.ts`
  - Change the signature of `selectActiveChatWalletInfo` from `(state: WalletState)` to `(state: WalletState, newChatContext: string | null | undefined)`.
  - Replace the internal `useAiStore.getState().newChatContext` with the `newChatContext` argument to make the selector pure.
  - **Also in this step**: Update the corresponding test file `packages/store/src/walletStore.selectors.test.ts`. Update all callsites within this test file to use the new signature. The original RED test from `78.f.i` will now pass.

- [‚úÖ] 78.f.iii. RED: Prove `GenerateContributionButton` is broken with new selector
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/GenerateContributionButton.test.tsx`
  - The tests in this file will now fail to compile (RED) because the component's `useWalletStore` hook uses the old selector signature. This proves the component must be updated.

- [‚úÖ] 78.f.iv. GREEN: Update `GenerateContributionButton` and its tests
  - [UI]
  - **File**: `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/GenerateContributionButton.tsx`
  - In the component, subscribe to `useAiStore` to get the `newChatContext` reactively.
  - Update the call to `useWalletStore` to use a new inline selector that passes the reactive context: `useWalletStore(state => selectActiveChatWalletInfo(state, newChatContext))`.
  - **Also in this step**: Update the corresponding test file `apps/web/src/components/dialectic/GenerateContributionButton.test.tsx`. Refactor the mocks to handle the new inline selector pattern. Once complete, all tests in this file will pass.

- [‚úÖ] 78.g. REFACTOR: Audit other consumers of `selectActiveChatWalletInfo`
  - [REFACTOR] [REVIEW]
  - Grep the codebase for other places that use `selectActiveChatWalletInfo`.
  - Apply the same reactive pattern from 78.f.v to any other components that use this selector to ensure consistent, reactive behavior across the application.

- [‚úÖ] 79. API: Preserve walletId pass-through
  - [API]
  - **File**: `packages/api/src/dialectic.api.ts`
  - Confirm `generateContributions(payload)` forwards `walletId`

  - [‚úÖ] 79. API: Preserve walletId pass-through
  - [API]
  - **File**: `packages/api/src/dialectic.api.ts`
  - Confirm `generateContributions(payload)` forwards `walletId` unchanged in the JSON body (no mutation). Add an explicit unit test to assert POST payload contains `walletId`.

- [‚úÖ] 80. TEST: Add end-to-end store ‚Üí API ‚Üí function RED/ GREEN
  - [TEST-INT]
  - **Files**: 
    - `packages/store/src/dialecticStore.test.ts`
    - `packages/api/src/dialectic.api.contribution.test.ts`
  - RED: simulate personal and org contexts; assert `walletId` is included on API call; without selector set, store refuses to submit (disabled/gated path).
  - GREEN: after store change, tests pass and show correct propagation of `walletId`.

## Notifications and Error Propagation: Dialectic Worker/Service ‚Üí Frontend (TDD)

Problem: Backend failures (e.g., NSF/affordability preflight, validation, unhandled exceptions) are not reflected in the UI. The UI remains stuck in a generic "retrying" state because only user-facing notifications are emitted on failure, while internal lifecycle events (which drive placeholder state updates) are not sent for failures.

Objective: Emit an internal `contribution_generation_failed` event from all failure paths in the worker and service, and ensure the frontend store routes and applies the failure to the correct placeholder using `job_id`, surfacing a specific error message (e.g., insufficient funds) instead of a generic retry loop message.

- [‚úÖ] 81.a. RED: Store routes internal failed events to placeholder failure
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `packages/store/src/notificationStore.test.ts`
  - Add a test that:
    - Creates a fake in-memory project/session with pending placeholders (with `job_id` assigned).
    - Calls `handleIncomingNotification` with an internal (`is_internal_event: true`) notification: `{ type: 'contribution_generation_failed', data: { sessionId, job_id, error: { code: 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS', message: 'Insufficient funds...' } } }`.
    - Asserts `useDialecticStore.getState()._handleDialecticLifecycleEvent` was invoked and that the matching placeholder is set to `failed` with `error.message` preserved.

- [‚úÖ] 81.b. GREEN: Ensure store failure routing is wired
  - [STORE]
  - If the RED test fails, minimally adjust `packages/store/src/notificationStore.ts` to include `job_id` when constructing the payload for type `'contribution_generation_failed'` and verify it calls `useDialecticStore.getState()._handleDialecticLifecycleEvent`.

- [‚úÖ] 82.a. RED: Define internal failure notification API on backend
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/_shared/utils/notification.service.test.ts`
  - Add tests for a new method `sendContributionFailedEvent(payload, targetUserId)` that constructs an internal event:
    - `notification_type: 'contribution_generation_failed'`
    - `is_internal_event: true`
    - `notification_data` contains `{ sessionId, job_id, error: { code, message } }`.

- [‚úÖ] 82.b. GREEN: Implement internal failure event
  - [BE]
  - **Files**:
    - `supabase/functions/_shared/types/notification.service.types.ts` (add method signature)
    - `supabase/functions/_shared/utils/notification.service.ts` (implement `_sendNotification` call with `is_internal_event: true`)

- [‚úÖ] 83.a. RED: Worker final failure emits internal failure event
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processSimpleJob.test.ts`
  - Arrange a scenario where attempts are exhausted (or where the error is non-retryable; see 84) and assert:
    - `notificationService.sendContributionFailedEvent` is called with `{ sessionId, job_id, error: { code: 'RETRY_LOOP_FAILED' | specific, message } }`.
    - Existing user-facing `sendContributionFailedNotification` remains called (do not remove).

- [‚úÖ] 83.b. GREEN: Emit internal failure on final failure in worker
  - [BE]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processSimpleJob.ts`
  - In the final failure path (where status is set to `'retry_loop_failed'`), call `notificationService.sendContributionFailedEvent(...)` with `sessionId`, `job_id`, and a typed `error` reflecting the last failure reason.

- [‚úÖ] 84.a. RED: Non-retryable errors fail immediately with internal event (no retry)
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processSimpleJob.test.ts`
  - Add cases where `executeModelCallAndSave` throws:
    - `ContextWindowError`
    - Error with message matching affordability/NSF (e.g., contains `"Insufficient funds"`)
  - Assert for each:
    - Job is marked failed (not `retrying`),
    - `retryJob` is NOT called,
    - `sendContributionFailedEvent` is called with `{ code: 'CONTEXT_WINDOW_ERROR' | 'INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS', message }`.

- [‚úÖ] 84.b. GREEN: Implement non-retryable classification
  - [BE]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processSimpleJob.ts`
  - In the `catch` block, detect non-retryable errors: `instanceof ContextWindowError` or `error.message` includes insufficient-funds patterns. For such cases, set job status to `'failed'`, emit `sendContributionFailedEvent`, and return without invoking `retryJob`.

- [‚úÖ] 84.c. RED: Wallet missing is immediate failure (no retry)
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processSimpleJob.test.ts`
  - Arrange for `executeModelCallAndSave` to throw `new Error('Wallet is required to process model calls.')`.
  - Assert: job `status: 'failed'`, no `retryJob` call, and both notifications sent:
    - Internal: `sendContributionGenerationFailedEvent({ type: 'other_generation_failed', sessionId, job_id, error: { code: 'WALLET_MISSING', message } })`
    - User-facing: `sendContributionFailedNotification(...)`.

- [‚úÖ] 84.d. GREEN: Implement wallet-missing classification
  - [BE]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processSimpleJob.ts`
  - In the non-retryable branch, detect message containing `wallet is required` and emit immediate failure with code `WALLET_MISSING` (internal + user-facing), then return (no retry).

- [‚úÖ] 84.e. RED: Preflight dependency missing is immediate failure
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processSimpleJob.test.ts`
  - Arrange for `executeModelCallAndSave` path to surface messages like `Token wallet service is required for affordability preflight`.
  - Assert: job `status: 'failed'`, no `retryJob`, internal `other_generation_failed` and user-facing failure notifications.

- [‚úÖ] 84.f. GREEN: Implement preflight dependency classification
  - [BE]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processSimpleJob.ts`
  - Map affordability preflight/dependency messages to `INTERNAL_DEPENDENCY_MISSING` and emit internal + user-facing notifications; return without retry.

- [‚úÖ] 85.a. RED: Service entry failures emit internal failure events
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/index.test.ts`
  - For (1) invalid payload path and (2) unhandled exception path, assert `sendContributionGenerationFailedEvent` is invoked with `{ type: 'other_generation_failed', sessionId: job.session_id, job_id, error }`.

- [‚úÖ] 85.b. GREEN: Emit internal failure from service entry
  - [BE]
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/index.ts`
  - In invalid-payload and catch-all failure paths, add `notificationService.sendContributionGenerationFailedEvent({ type: 'other_generation_failed', sessionId, job_id, error })` alongside the existing user-facing notification (do not remove existing behavior).

- [‚úÖ] 85.c. RED: Router handles `other_generation_failed` internal events
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - **File**: `packages/store/src/notificationStore.test.ts`
  - Send an internal notification `{ type: 'other_generation_failed', data: { sessionId, job_id, error } }`.
  - Assert: it routes to `useDialecticStore()._handleDialecticLifecycleEvent` with a payload equivalent to failure handling (same path as `contribution_generation_failed`), and no user-facing notification is added.

- [‚úÖ] 85.d. GREEN: Implement router mapping for `other_generation_failed`
  - [FE-STORE]
  - **File**: `packages/store/src/notificationStore.ts`
  - In the internal event switch, handle `other_generation_failed` by constructing the same failure payload shape used for `contribution_generation_failed` and forward to `_handleDialecticLifecycleEvent`.

- [‚úÖ] 86. RED: End-to-end integration shows UI placeholder transitions to failed with specific message
  - [TEST-INT]
  - **File**: `supabase/integration_tests/services/dialectic_pipeline.integration.test.ts`
  - Simulate a job that triggers NSF (e.g., tiny balance vs. large prompt). Assert that a Realtime internal notification (type `other_generation_failed`) is emitted and that the UI-facing store (via test harness) sets the placeholder status to `failed` with the NSF message, not a generic retry message.

- [‚úÖ] 87. REVIEW: Ensure user-facing notifications still created
  - [REVIEW]
  - Verify `sendContributionFailedNotification` (user-facing, `is_internal_event: false`) is still sent so the Notifications UI preserves a historical record; internal events should handle state changes, not toasts.

## Ensure dialectic-service passes all tests  

- [‚úÖ] 88. REFACTOR: Align `FileType` usage in `cloneProject.ts`
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/cloneProject.ts`
  - Replace string literals (e.g., `"project_readme"`, `"initial_user_prompt"`, `"seed_prompt"`, `"general_resource"`, `"contribution_document"`) with the correct `FileType` enum members. Fix swapped hints for `model_contribution_main` vs `model_contribution_raw_json`. Remove unused `getFileTypeFromResourceDescription`.

- [‚úÖ] 89. REFACTOR: Correct `ContributionType` assignments
  - **Files**:
    - `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.ts`
    - `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/saveContributionEdit.ts`
    - `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/cloneProject.ts`
  - Ensure fields typed as `ContributionType | null` are assigned only valid enum values (no raw strings). Map source strings to enum safely without casting.

  - [‚úÖ] 89.a. RED: Add canonical export-zip path contract to constructor tests
    - [TEST-UNIT]
    - Files:
      - supabase/functions/_shared/utils/path_constructor.test.ts
    - Add tests asserting:
      - constructStoragePath({ projectId, fileType: ProjectExportZip, originalFileName }) returns:
        - storagePath === projectId
        - fileName === sanitizeForPath(originalFileName)
      - GeneralResource remains directory-based: constructStoragePath({ projectId, fileType: GeneralResource, originalFileName }) ‚Üí storagePath === `${projectId}/general_resource`, fileName === sanitized file.
    - Expected: Fails to compile (ProjectExportZip missing) and/or test fails.

  - [‚úÖ] 89.b. GREEN: Introduce FileType.ProjectExportZip and route in FileManager
    - [REFACTOR]
    - Files:
      - supabase/functions/_shared/types/file_manager.types.ts
      - supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.ts
    - Changes:
      - Add enum member ProjectExportZip = 'project_export_zip'.
      - getTableForFileType: return 'dialectic_project_resources' for 'project_export_zip'.
    - Lint; compile should pass for enum and routing.

  - [‚úÖ] 89.c. GREEN: Implement ProjectExportZip in path_constructor
    - [BE]
    - Files:
      - supabase/functions/_shared/utils/path_constructor.ts
    - Add case:
      - FileType.ProjectExportZip ‚Üí { storagePath: projectId, fileName: sanitizeForPath(originalFileName) }
    - Lint and run constructor tests (previous RED now GREEN).

  - [‚úÖ] 89.d. RED: Deconstructor guarantees for directory/file separation
    - [TEST-UNIT]
    - Files:
      - supabase/functions/_shared/utils/path_deconstructor.test.ts
    - Add tests asserting deconstructStoragePath can correctly parse when storage path and file name are provided separately for:
      - ModelContributionMain paths: `${projectId}/session_${shortId}/iteration_1/1_thesis` + fileName: `{model_slug}_0_thesis.md`.
      - GeneralResource: `${projectId}/general_resource` + fileName: `resource1.txt`.
      - InitialUserPrompt: `${projectId}` + fileName: `initial_prompt.md`.
    - Note: The deconstructor is not required to parse ProjectExportZip (zip path is a single file at project root), so do not add a pattern for it.
    - Expected: If patterns are missing or fileTypeGuess is incorrect for any of the above, tests fail.

  - [‚úÖ] 89.e. GREEN: Align path_deconstructor to canonical directory-only storage_path
    - [BE]
    - Files:
      - supabase/functions/_shared/utils/path_deconstructor.ts
    - Verify existing patterns:
      - Model contribution (main/raw) already expects separate storageDir and fileName: no change if tests pass.
      - GeneralResource pattern: `^([^/]+)/general_resource/([^/]+)$` ‚Üí fileName is matched; adjust to accept directory-only storageDir with separate fileName argument. (If already supported via params.storageDir/fileName, ensure tests pass without changing regex; else, minimally adjust.)
      - InitialUserPrompt: keep root-level file handling (pattern present).
    - Lint; deconstructor tests now GREEN.

  - [‚úÖ] 89.f. RED: Export tests assert directory+filename joins and zip at project root
    - [TEST-UNIT]
    - Files:
      - supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.test.ts
    - Assert:
      - Resource download: bucket, `${resource.storage_path}/${resource.file_name}`.
      - Contribution content download: bucket, `${contribution.storage_path}/${contribution.file_name}`.
      - Raw download: bucket, `contribution.raw_response_storage_path` as-is.
      - FileManager upload: pathContext.fileType === 'project_export_zip' (ProjectExportZip), projectId set, originalFileName set.
      - Signed URL creation: uses joined `${storage_path}/${file_name}` from FileManager record.
      - Zip entries include canonical full paths for all downloaded files; include project_manifest.json at root.
    - Expected: Fails on current exportProject.ts typing/paths and missing FileType.ProjectExportZip usage.

  - [‚úÖ] 89.g. GREEN: Implement canonical export in exportProject.ts
    - [BE]
    - Files:
      - supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.ts
    - Changes:
      - ContributionType mapping (fix TS2322):
        - contribution_type: isContributionType(c.contribution_type ?? '') ? c.contribution_type : (isContributionType(stageObject.slug) ? stageObject.slug : null)
      - Download paths:
        - Resources: `${resource.storage_path}/${resource.file_name}`
        - Contribution content: `${contribution.storage_path}/${contribution.file_name}`
        - Raw response: `contribution.raw_response_storage_path`
      - Zip layout: add files using those canonical full paths; keep project_manifest.json at root only.
      - Upload export zip via FileManager:
        - pathContext.fileType = ProjectExportZip
        - pathContext.projectId = projectId
        - pathContext.originalFileName = computed export filename
      - Signed URL: createSignedUrlForPath(bucket, `${fileRecord.storage_path}/${fileRecord.file_name}`, expiresIn)
    - Lint; export tests‚Äô RED should be GREEN.

  - [‚úÖ] 89.h. RED: FileManager routing test for ProjectExportZip
    - [TEST-UNIT]
    - Files:
      - supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.test.ts (or a new minimal test colocated)
    - Add a case asserting getTableForFileType('project_export_zip') routes to 'dialectic_project_resources'.
    - Expected: Fails if not routed correctly.

  - [‚úÖ] 89.i. GREEN: Confirm FileManager routing and registration for zip uploads
    - [BE]
    - Files:
      - supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.ts
    - Ensure new case already implemented in 89.b; if not, add routing and minimal registration logic validation.
    - Lint; routing test now GREEN.

  - [‚úÖ] 89.j. REVIEW: Canonical root preservation and UI handoff
    - [REVIEW]
    - Confirm that:
      - The resulting export zip record resolves to path `${projectId}/${exportFileName}.zip` (storage_path is projectId, file_name sanitized).
      - The export function returns a signed URL to that exact path for DialecticProjectCard.handleExport to trigger browser download.
      - No zip file is added inside the zip; only stored at project root as a separate file (per canonical tree).

- [‚úÖ] 90. REFACTOR: Fix `FileType.GeneralResource` and related
  - **Files**:
    - `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.ts`
    - `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/cloneProject.ts`
  - Replace any `"general_resource"` string with the correct `FileType` enum. Verify all `PathContext.fileType` assignments compile.

- [‚úÖ] 91. REFACTOR: Clean up unused vars
  - **Files**:
    - `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/index.ts` (remove unused `EdgeRuntime` identifier if present)
    - `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/updateSessionModels.ts` (remove/underscore `projectData`)
  - Ensure ESLint `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` passes.

- [‚úÖ] 92. REFACTOR: Fix action names and payloads in integration tests
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/dialectic-service.integration.test.ts`
  - Replace invalid actions (e.g., `listAvailableDomainTags` ‚Üí `listAvailableDomains`, `updateProjectDomainTag` ‚Üí `updateProjectDomain`, `getContributionContentSignedUrl` ‚Üí `getContributionContentData`).
  - Correct payload shapes (e.g., use `GetContributionContentDataPayload`, `GetSessionDetailsPayload` without extra fields). Provide required fields for `GenerateContributionsPayload` (`projectId`, `walletId`).
  - Remove/replace queries against missing tables or wrong types.

- [‚úÖ] 93. REFACTOR: Fix table/query type usages in integration tests
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/dialectic-service.integration.test.ts`
  - Replace `.from('dialectic_session_models')` with the correct relation per `types_db.ts` (use supported tables). Ensure test inserts/selects target valid tables/columns.

- [‚úÖ] 94. REFACTOR: Update session/contribution property access in integration tests
  - **Files**:
    - `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/getProjectDetails.integration.test.ts`
  - Use the correct response type (e.g., `GetSessionDetailsResponse`) or navigate via fetched payloads that include `dialectic_session_models` / `dialectic_contributions`. Avoid assuming these arrays on `DialecticSession` if not present in the type context used by the test.

- [‚úÖ] 95. REFACTOR: Provide required fields in `exportProject.test.ts`
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/exportProject.test.ts`
  - Add missing `document_relationships` field on mocked `dialectic_contributions` rows to satisfy `types_db.ts` requirements.

- [‚úÖ] 96. REFACTOR: Repair missing local module imports
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/index.ts`
  - Remove or correct invalid imports referencing `_shared/services/indexing.ts` and `_shared/services/embedding.ts` (align with current service paths or remove if unused).

- [‚úÖ] 97. REFACTOR: Replace missing test helpers
  - **File**: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/dialectic-stages.integration.test.ts`
  - Remove `setupSuite/beforeEachTest/afterEachTest/teardownSuite` references or replace with standard `Deno.test` structure/shared helpers that exist in-repo.

  ## Build a SSOT for token output caps. 

- [‚úÖ] 98. RED: Define single-source output cap contract (SSOT)
  - [TEST-UNIT]
  - Files:
    - `supabase/functions/_shared/utils/affordability_utils.test.ts`
  - Add tests for a unified SSOT function (keep name `getMaxOutputTokens`) that returns the maximum output tokens allowed such that:
    - It MINs across caps:
      - User-budget cap using spend fraction F = 0.80 after reserving input cost: `floor(min(balance * F, balance - inputCost) / outputRate)`
      - `hard_cap_output_tokens` (> 0)
      - `provider_max_output_tokens` (> 0)
    - Returns 0 when rates/balance are invalid or `balance < inputCost`.
    - Cases: (a) user cap < provider cap ‚Üí user cap wins; (b) user cap > provider cap ‚Üí provider cap wins; (c) both caps absent ‚Üí budget-only cap; (d) invalid inputs throw.

- [‚úÖ] 99. GREEN: Implement SSOT output cap (spend fraction = 0.80)
  - [BE]
  - File: `supabase/functions/_shared/utils/affordability_utils.ts`
  - Update `getMaxOutputTokens` to:
