## Legend

*   [ ] Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference 
    *   [ ] Worksteps will be nested as shown
        *   [ ] Nesting can be as deep as logically required 
*   [✅] Represents a completed step or nested set
*   [🚧] Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set
*   [⏸️] Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking 
*   [❓] Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing 
*   [🚫] Represents a blocked, halted, stopped step or nested set that has some unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing

## Component Types and Labels

* **[COMMIT]:** Checkpoint for Git Commit

## Implementation Plan Overview

This implementation plan follows a phased approach, with each phase building on the previous one:

1. **Project Setup & Planning:** Initialize the project structure, branches, and establish development practices
2. **Database & Backend Foundation:** Implement core database schema changes and RLS policies
3. **API Client Integration:** Update API client methods to support organization context
4. **Store Refactoring:** Modify state management to support organization-scoped chats
5. **Core UI Components:** Implement primary UI components for organization chat context
6. **Bug Fixes:** Address identified user experience issues
7. **Chat Experience Enhancements:** Implement markdown support, token tracking, etc.
8. **Testing & Refinement:** Comprehensive testing and final adjustments
9. **Documentation & Deployment:** Create documentation and prepare for release

    *   [ ] Review all new/modified code across `supabase/functions/`, `packages/api/`, `packages/store/`, `packages/types/`, `apps/web/`.
    *   [ ] Check for: clarity, efficiency, adherence to project standards (`DEV_PLAN.md`), proper TypeScript usage (types, interfaces), error handling, logging (using `@paynless/utils logger`), potential race conditions, security considerations (input validation, RLS reliance), leftover TODOs/comments.
*   [ ] **Step 6.2.2: [TEST-UNIT][TEST-INT] Test Coverage Review**
    *   [ ] Run code coverage reports (`npm run test:coverage` if configured).
    *   [ ] Identify critical paths or complex logic with low coverage.
    *   [ ] Add missing unit or integration tests to improve confidence. Focus on logic, edge cases, and error handling.
*   [ ] **Step 6.2.3: [COMMIT] Commit Final Refactoring & Test Improvements**

    *   [ ] Ensure consistent use of `shadcn/ui` styling, spacing, and theming utilities (`cn` function). (REQ-UX-2.1).
*   [ ] **Step 6.3.2: [TEST-UNIT] Update Component Tests**
    *   [ ] Update unit/integration tests for components that were changed to use `shadcn/ui`. Ensure tests still pass and correctly reflect the new structure/props. Snapshot tests may need updating.
*   [ ] **Step 6.3.3: [COMMIT] Commit UI Standardization**
    *   [ ] Stage modified components and tests.

*   [ ] **Step 6.5.1: [TEST-E2E] Execute Comprehensive Manual Test Plan**
    *   [ ] Re-test all user flows defined in SYNTHESIS #2 (Admin, Member, Individual contexts).
    *   [ ] **Organization Context:**
        *   Create personal chat.
        *   Switch to Org A. Create org chat (as admin).
        *   Switch to Org B. Verify Org A chat not visible. Create Org B chat.
        *   Switch back to Org A. Verify Org A chat visible, Org B not.
        *   As Org A admin, disable member chat creation in settings.
        *   Log in as Org A member. Verify cannot create Org A chat.
        *   Log in as Org A admin. Re-enable member creation.
        *   Log in as Org A member. Verify *can* create Org A chat.
        *   Log in as Org A admin. Delete Org A chat created by member. Verify gone.
        *   Log in as Org A member. Verify chat is gone.
    *   [ ] **Core Chat Features:**
        *   Verify default provider/prompt load.
        *   Verify chat history loads correctly in each context.
        *   Test navigation between many chats.

        *   Test Rewind/Reprompt: rewind early, rewind middle, rewind last. Verify history truncation.
    *   [ ] **Error Handling:**
        *   Simulate network errors (e.g., browser devtools offline mode) during message send/load. Verify error messages/boundaries.
        *   Attempt actions without permissions (e.g., member deleting org chat). Verify UI prevents or shows error.
        *   Test empty states (no chats, no messages).
    *   [ ] **UI Consistency:**
        *   Check `shadcn/ui` component usage, loading states (skeletons), context indicators.

### STEP-6.6: Complete Prior Stage Cleanup Tasks [ ]

#### STEP-6.6.1 Phase 1 Cleanup 
*   [ ] **[REFACTOR]** Move `HandlerError` class from `api-subscriptions` to a shared location (e.g., `_shared/errors.ts` or similar) and update imports in `chat-details` and other functions.
*   [ ] **[REFACTOR]** Improve client-side request replay logic (e.g., in `ApiClient`) to handle standard 401 responses (`{"error": ...}`), allowing backend functions like `chat-details` to remove special `{"msg": ...}` formatting for 401s.
*   [ ] **[REFACTOR]** Add stricter validation (e.g., regex check) for the `chatId` path parameter in the `chat-details` Edge Function to ensure it conforms to a UUID format.
*   [ ] **[TEST-DEBUG]** Investigate and resolve Deno test leaks (approx. 19-25 intervals from `SupabaseAuthClient._startAutoRefresh`) in `supabase/functions/chat/test/chat.integration.test.ts`. Current hypothesis: multiple `signInWithPassword` calls on the same client instance, or clients created within `mainHandler` via DI not being fully cleaned up despite `signOut` attempts. Consider refactoring tests to use one client per authenticated user session and ensuring explicit sign-out for each.
*   [ ] **[TEST-DEBUG]** Deno integration tests for `chat-details` (`supabase/functions/chat-details/test/chat-details.integration.test.ts`) are failing due to interval leaks (approx. 4-6 intervals from `SupabaseAuthClient._startAutoRefresh`), even though all individual test steps pass. This is similar to the issue in `chat` tests and may require a similar investigation or deferral.
*   [ ] **[TEST-DEBUG]** Deno integration tests for `chat-history` (`supabase/functions/chat-history/test/chat-history.integration.test.ts`) are failing due to interval leaks (approx. 4 intervals from `SupabaseAuthClient._startAutoRefresh`), even though all individual test steps pass. This is similar to the issues in `chat` and `chat-details` tests and may require similar investigation or deferral.
*   [ ] **[TEST-DEBUG]** `Post` for new org chat should include `organizationId` in insert test is failing to spy problems

#### STEP-6.6.2 Phase 2 Cleanup 
#### BACKLOG ITEM: Add/Verify Remaining Analytics Integration [ANALYTICS] [COMMIT]
* [ ] Review all actions in packages to implement app analytics.
* [ ] Review all actions in `useAiStore` and `useOrganizationStore`.
* [ ] Verify all analytics events defined in Phase 0 (STEP-0.2.3) are correctly implemented within the relevant store actions, including parameters:
    * `useAiStore`: `chat_context_selected` (triggered by subscription), `organization_chat_created`, `organization_chat_deleted`, `chat_rewind_used`.
    * `useOrganizationStore`: `member_chat_creation_toggled`.
    * *Note:* Events like `organization_chat_viewed` and `token_usage_viewed` might be better suited for the UI layer when the relevant component mounts or 
    data is displayed.
* [ ] Add any missing triggers.
* [ ] Commit changes with message "feat(ANALYTICS): Ensure all required analytics events are triggered from store actions"

#### STEP-6.6.3 Phase 3 Cleanup 
#### STEP-6.6.4 Phase 4 Cleanup 
#### STEP-6.6.5 Phase 5 Cleanup
