# **State Hydration Fixes**

## Problem Statement
The dialectic UI has persistent state management problems where realtime updates don't reflect correctly in the UI, requiring page refreshes. See `docs/state-hydration-issues.md` for full analysis.

## Objectives
1. Realtime document counting via lifecycle events updating `progress.jobs`
2. "Done" derived from document completion, not step completion
3. Server-persisted viewing stage (`viewing_stage_id` on `dialectic_sessions`)
4. Clean SubmitResponsesButton with 6 explicit, data-driven conditions
5. `submitStageResponses` applies `updatedSession` to store immediately
6. Stage tab focus persisted and restored from server

## Expected Outcome
All six front-end hydration symptoms resolved without page refresh. No defaults, no guesses, no fallbacks. State driven by server-authoritative data and realtime lifecycle events.

# Instructions for Agent
* Read `docs/Instructions for Agent.md` before every turn.
* Read `docs/state-hydration-issues.md` for domain context before every turn.

# Work Breakdown Structure

## Phase 1: Realtime job tracking (Issues 1 & 2)

*   `[✅]`   [STORE] packages/store/src/`upsertJobFromLifecycleEvent.ts` **Upsert progress.jobs entry from lifecycle event data**
    *   `[✅]`   `objective`

        *   `[✅]`   If a job with matching id already exists in the array, update its status in-place (retries update existing jobs)
        *   `[✅]`   If no matching job exists, append a new JobProgressDto

            *   `[✅]`   Deps: `UpsertJobFromLifecycleEventDeps` — none (pure function, no injected dependencies)
            *   `[✅]`   Params: `UpsertJobFromLifecycleEventParams` — `{ jobId: string, documentKey: string | null, modelId: string | null, stepKey: string | null, jobType: RecipeJobType | null, status: string }`

        *   `[✅]`   Uses existing types: `JobProgressDto`, `StageRunProgressSnapshot`, `RecipeJobType` from @paynless/types

        *   `[✅]`   Test: sets jobType, stepKey, modelId, documentKey correctly on new entry
        *   `[✅]`   Test: does not duplicate jobs on repeated calls with same job_id

    *   `[✅]`   `upsertJobFromLifecycleEvent.ts`
        *   `[✅]`   Find existing job by id in progress.jobs
        *   `[✅]`   If found: update status field AND merge any non-null fields from the incoming event into the existing entry (later events may provide stepKey, documentKey, modelId that were null on creation)

    *   `[✅]`   `objective`
        *   `[✅]`   Every lifecycle handler in dialecticStore.documents.ts that processes a document/render event must call upsertJobFromLifecycleEvent so progress.jobs stays current in realtime

*   `[✅]`   [STORE] packages/store/src/`dialecticStore.ts` **Wire upsertJobFromLifecycleEvent into store-level lifecycle handlers (planner, execute, render_chunk, job_failed, and all contribution-level events)**
    *   `[✅]`   `objective`
        *   `[✅]`   Lifecycle handlers in dialecticStore.ts that are NOT delegated to dialecticStore.documents.ts also need to upsert into progress.jobs
        *   `[✅]`   Two payload families handled here:
            *   `[✅]`   **JobNotificationEvent payloads** (have stageSlug, step_key, job_id): planner_started, planner_completed, execute_started, execute_chunk_completed, execute_completed, render_chunk_completed, job_failed

        *   `[✅]`   Each handler has access to get/set and the event payload
        *   `[✅]`   progressKey is computable from event.sessionId, event.stageSlug, event.iterationNumber (for JobNotificationEvent payloads)
        *   `[✅]`   Contribution-level payloads lack stageSlug — look up the job's existing entry across all progress snapshots by job_id to find which snapshot it belongs to, then upsert into that snapshot
    *   `[✅]`   `event-to-action mapping (15 events handled in this file)`
        *   `[✅]`   **JobNotificationEvent payloads (all use upsertJobFromLifecycleEvent):**

        *   `[✅]`   Test: planner_started upserts job with status 'processing' and jobType 'PLAN'
        *   `[✅]`   Test: planner_completed upserts job with status 'completed' and jobType 'PLAN'
        *   `[✅]`   Test: execute_started upserts job with status 'processing' and jobType 'EXECUTE' (with or without document_key — same path)

        *   `[✅]`   Provides: updated progress.jobs visible to selectors
    *   `[✅]`   `requirements`
        *   `[✅]`   All 15 lifecycle event types handled in this file result in a progress.jobs upsert or documented exemption
        *   `[✅]`   contribution_generation_paused_nsf is the only event that cannot upsert (no job_id on payload) — this is documented, not an oversight
        *   `[✅]`   Existing handler behavior (updating contribution lists, session sync, stepStatuses) is preserved unchanged

*   `[✅]`   [STORE] packages/store/src/`dialecticStore.selectors.ts` **Gate 'completed' stageStatus on document completion**
    *   `[✅]`   `objective`
        *   `[✅]`   The store already has everything needed to track both progress and completion: the recipe DAG (steps, edges, inputs_required, outputs_required) is in recipesByStageSlug, step statuses are in progress.stepStatuses (driven by lifecycle events from ALL jobs), job entries are in progress.jobs (populated by nodes 1-3 for every job type), and document descriptors are in progress.documents (fetched when rendered documents complete)
        *   `[✅]`   A recipe is a DAG of PLAN and EXECUTE steps. Each step spawns jobs based on its granularity_strategy. Most jobs produce intermediate artifacts (header_context, assembled_json) and do NOT have a document_key — that is expected. RENDER is a system operation (not a recipe step) that produces the final user-facing markdown documents after EXECUTE.
        *   `[✅]`   **Progress** is derived from step statuses, which reflect ALL jobs in the DAG — planners, intermediate executions, terminal executions, everything. This is how the user knows work is happening.
        *   `[✅]`   **Completion** is proven by rendered documents. The recipe defines how many rendered markdown documents the stage must produce (totalDocumentsForStage, a fixed count from selectValidMarkdownDocumentKeys). Each document must be rendered for every selected model. Only when every document set is fully rendered is the stage complete. Steps and jobs completing is necessary but not sufficient — RENDER must finish and produce the documents.
        *   `[✅]`   The bug: line 921 sets stageStatus = 'completed' when completedSteps === totalSteps. This fires when all steps finish, but RENDER may not have produced all documents yet. Fix: gate 'completed' on completedDocumentsForStage === totalDocumentsForStage && totalDocumentsForStage > 0

        *   `[✅]`   Existing types: StageProgressDetail, UnifiedProjectProgress, UnifiedProjectStatus from @paynless/types
        *   `[✅]`   progress.jobs populated by lifecycle events (producer: nodes 1-3) — ALL job types, not just document-bearing jobs
        *   `[✅]`   progress.stepStatuses driven by all lifecycle events — reflects every job in the DAG regardless of document_key
        *   `[✅]`   progress.documents populated when rendered documents are fetched
        *   `[✅]`   recipesByStageSlug provides the recipe DAG including outputs_required per step

        *   `[✅]`   Reads: stageRunProgress, recipesByStageSlug, currentProcessTemplate from state
    *   `[✅]`   unit/`dialecticStore.selectors.test.ts`
        *   `[✅]`   Test: stageStatus is NOT 'completed' when all steps are done but not all document sets are complete (steps finishing does not prove RENDER produced documents)
        *   `[✅]`   Test: stageStatus is 'completed' when completedDocumentsForStage === totalDocumentsForStage && totalDocumentsForStage > 0
        *   `[✅]`   Test: stageStatus is 'in_progress' when jobs are running mid-DAG (PLAN, intermediate EXECUTE) even though no rendered documents exist yet — progress comes from step statuses, not documents
        *   `[✅]`   Test: progress statuses (in_progress, failed, paused) derived from step statuses, which reflect ALL jobs including those without document_key
        *   `[✅]`   Test: "n/n" reflects completedDocumentsForStage / totalDocumentsForStage — totalDocuments is a fixed count from the recipe's expected rendered markdown outputs, completedDocuments is how many document sets are fully rendered across all selected models
    *   `[✅]`   `dialecticStore.selectors.ts`
        *   `[✅]`   Replace line 921 step-based completion check with document-based: if totalDocumentsForStage > 0 && completedDocumentsForStage === totalDocumentsForStage then 'completed'
        *   `[✅]`   Existing document counting logic (lines 926-953) already iterates validMarkdownKeys and filters progress.jobs for entries with matching documentKey — only the subset of jobs with document_key contribute to document completion counting; most jobs lack document_key and that is correct
        *   `[✅]`   Preserve 'failed' status derivation from step statuses (a failed step is still relevant — step statuses reflect all jobs)
        *   `[✅]`   Preserve 'in_progress', 'paused_nsf', 'paused_user' from step statuses

## Phase 5: Cleanup

*   `[ ]`   [UI] apps/web/src/hooks/`useStageProgressPolling.ts` **Evaluate and simplify polling after realtime job tracking**
    *   `[ ]`   `objective`
        *   `[ ]`   With progress.jobs updated in realtime, evaluate whether aggressive 1s polling and triple-refresh-on-completion are still necessary
        *   `[ ]`   If polling is still needed (belt-and-suspenders for missed events), reduce frequency and remove multi-refresh hacks
        *   `[ ]`   If polling is no longer needed, remove the hook entirely and remove its usage from SessionContributionsDisplayCard
    *   `[ ]`   `role`
        *   `[ ]`   UI — React hook
    *   `[ ]`   `module`

    *   `[ ]`   `directionality`
        *   `[ ]`   Layer: UI
    *   `[ ]`   `requirements`
        *   `[ ]`   No unnecessary server load from aggressive polling
        *   `[ ]`   Realtime updates are the primary mechanism, polling is backup at most

*   `[ ]`   [UI] apps/web/src/hooks/`useViewingStageSync.ts` **Evaluate and simplify after server-persisted viewing stage**
    *   `[ ]`   `objective`
        *   `[ ]`   With viewing_stage_id server-persisted and activeStageSlug set from it on load, evaluate whether the useActiveStageSync hook is still necessary
        *   `[ ]`   If activeContextStage can be derived from activeStageSlug inside a selector or set atomically in setViewingStage, this hook can be removed
    *   `[ ]`   `role`
        *   `[ ]`   UI — React hook
    *   `[ ]`   `module`
        *   `[ ]`   apps/web/src/hooks/useActiveStageSync.ts

    *   `[ ]`   `directionality`
        *   `[ ]`   Layer: UI
    *   `[ ]`   `requirements`
        *   `[ ]`   No render-cycle gap between activeStageSlug and activeContextStage
        *   `[ ]`   The two-property pattern either eliminated or made atomic
    *   `[ ]`   **Commit** `refactor(ui): simplify polling and stage sync hooks after hydration fixes`
        *   `[ ]`   useStageProgressPolling simplified or removed
        *   `[ ]`   useActiveStageSync simplified or removed



## StageDAGProgressDialog does not color nodes correctly, probably relies on explicit hydration instead of dynamic hydration from notifications
- Update StageDAGProgressDialog to use notifications to change color too 

## Highlight the chosen Chat or Project in the left sidebar 
- Currently the sidebar gives no indication of which Chat or Project the user has focused
- Outline and/or highlight the chosen Chat or Project in the left sidebar

## New user sign in banner doesn't display, throws console error  
- Chase, diagnose, fix 

## Refactor EMCAS to break apart the functions, segment out the tests
- Move gatherArtifacts call to processSimpleJob
- Decide where to measure & RAG

## Switch to stream-to-buffer instead of chunking
- This lets us render the buffer in real time to show document progress 

## Build test fixtures for major function groups 
- Provide standard mock factories and objects 
- dialectic-worker, dialectic-service, document_renderer, anything else that has huge test files  

## Support user-provided API keys for their preferred providers 

## Regenerate existing document from user feedback & edits 

## Have an additional user input panel where they user can build their own hybrid versions from the ones provided 
AND/OR
## Let the user pick/rate their preferred version and drop the others 

## Use a gentle color schema to differentiate model outputs visually / at a glance 

## When doc loads for the first time, position at top 

## Search across documents for key terms 

## Collect user satisfaction evaluation after each generation "How would you feel if you couldn't use this again?" 

## Add optional outputs for selected stages
- A "landing page" output for the proposal stage
-- Landing page
-- Hero banner
-- Call to action
-- Email sign up 
- A "financial analysis" output for the "refinement" stage
-- 1/3/5 year 
-- Conservative / base / aggressive
-- IS, BS, CF 
- A "generate next set of work" for the implementation stage
