## Problem Statement

## Objectives

## Expected Outcome

# Instructions for Agent
* Read `docs/Instructions for Agent.md` before every turn.

# Work Breakdown Structure

## StageDAGProgressDialog does not color nodes correctly, probably relies on explicit hydration instead of dynamic hydration from notifications
- Update StageDAGProgressDialog to use notifications to change color too 

## Highlight the chosen Chat or Project in the left sidebar 
- Currently the sidebar gives no indication of which Chat or Project the user has focused
- Outline and/or highlight the chosen Chat or Project in the left sidebar

## New user sign in banner doesn't display, throws console error  
- Chase, diagnose, fix 

## Refactor EMCAS to break apart the functions, segment out the tests
- Move gatherArtifacts call to processSimpleJob
- Decide where to measure & RAG

## Switch to stream-to-buffer instead of chunking
- This lets us render the buffer in real time to show document progress 

## Build test fixtures for major function groups 
- Provide standard mock factories and objects 
- dialectic-worker, dialectic-service, document_renderer, anything else that has huge test files  

## Support user-provided API keys for their preferred providers 

## Regenerate existing document from user feedback & edits 

## Have an additional user input panel where they user can build their own hybrid versions from the ones provided 
AND/OR
## Let the user pick/rate their preferred version and drop the others 

## Use a gentle color schema to differentiate model outputs visually / at a glance 

## When doc loads for the first time, position at top 

## Search across documents for key terms 

## Collect user satisfaction evaluation after each generation "How would you feel if you couldn't use this again?" 

## Add optional outputs for selected stages
- A "landing page" output for the proposal stage
-- Landing page
-- Hero banner
-- Call to action
-- Email sign up 
- A "financial analysis" output for the "refinement" stage
-- 1/3/5 year 
-- Conservative / base / aggressive
-- IS, BS, CF 
- A "generate next set of work" for the implementation stage 

## Ensure front end components use friendly names 
- SessionInfoCard uses formal names instead of friendly names 

## 504 Gateway Timeout on back end  
- Not failed, not running 
- Sometimes eventually resolves

## Set Free accounts to Gemini Flash only 
- Claude & ChatGPT only for paid
- Paying customers get BYOK (heavy lift)

## Front end hydration problems
- n/n Done still does not up date realtime, only on refresh
- SubmitResponsesButton does not appear when docs are done 
- SubmitResponses often disabled when docs are done until page refresh hydrates 
- These three are probably the same exact hydration problem 
- "Review" stage does not reliably advance, often have to refresh, then choose the stage, then click "Submit Responses" again
- StageTabCard does not stay on the focused stage when page refreshes
