# **Compression Jobs**

## Problem Statement

When an assembled model call exceeds the model's input window, the pipeline enters the legacy RAG compression loop (`compressPrompt` → `RagService` → `IndexingService` → `dialectic_memory`) and document generation fails. The RAG path is structurally unfit for this pipeline: it embeds synchronously inside Supabase (a universal block with no provenance or attribution), it retrieves session-wide with generic stage-template queries so every victim document is replaced by nearly the same snippet blob, and its output destroys the document structure downstream agents need to populate their JSON skeletons. The application generates quality documents end-to-end whenever compression does not run, and fails whenever it does.

## Objectives

* Replace RAG compression with first-class, job-driven, schema-targeted COMPRESS jobs that ride the existing stream model-call transport, per `Compression Jobs Scope.md` (same folder — the ratified scope & order this workplan implements; its CANONICAL CONTRACTS section governs every function shape in this plan).
* Make victim selection pure computation — `effectiveScore = candidateTokens × importance` (importance from `inputsRelevance` for documents, from positional `valueScore` for history) — with no embeddings anywhere; one victim per resume cycle, stopping as soon as the preflight fits.
* Persist compressed output as `CompressedContext` resource artifacts keyed by (session, consuming stage, target schema key, source identity), named `{source_basename}_compressed_for_{target_key}.md` in the consuming stage's `_work` directory; validate JSON-mode output structurally against the source (drift is a validated invariant); render through the source document's original template; overlay on resume; reuse across sibling agents via three-layer opportunistic dedup.
* Remove the RAG core entirely: `rag_service`, `indexing_service`, `dialectic_memory`, `match_dialectic_chunks`, and every `embeddingClient` call site.
* Land the remaining workstreams — WS-J, WS-S, WS-D and WS-X — at the commit seams the scope's COMMIT MAP names; every seam ends compiling with tests green.

## Expected Outcome

Oversized model inputs compress incrementally until the preflight fits: the parent job pauses via `waiting_for_children`, COMPRESS children run on the production stream path with the parent's own model, artifacts persist with full provenance and real wallet attribution, sibling jobs producing the same target reuse artifacts without recompressing, and the overlay swaps compressed content invisibly to the orchestrator. No synchronous model calls remain in Supabase; no RAG code or schema remains in the repo; a full-chain integration test proves the loop end to end.

# Instructions for Agent
* `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` for repo standards and requirements.
* `.cursor/commands/*.prompt.md` for task-specific direction. 
* `docs/implementations/Current/Checklists/Current/Compression Jobs Scope.md` — the ratified scope-and-order plan this workplan is built from. Canonical contracts, the commit map, design decisions, and the forbidden-token sweep live there.
* `Embedding Jobs.md` and `Embedding Jobs 2.md` (same folder) — SUPERSEDED workplans retained as crib material only. They were written against the abandoned `feat/embedding` baseline; anything lifted must be re-validated against `feat/compress` and must pass the scope's forbidden-token sweep.
* Baseline branch: `feat/compress`, cut from `development`.

# Work Breakdown Structure

* **Compression Jobs Implementation**

WS-0, WS-C, WS-R, WS-B, WS-N, WS-I, and WS-P are complete and their workplan files are retired. This file carries WS-J, WS-S, WS-D and WS-X. Node order within each workstream is as specified in the scope.

## WS-J — JOB PAYLOAD & MODEL-CALL SSOT (depends WS-P; gates WS-S and WS-D)

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/enqueueCompressJobs/enqueueCompressJobs.ts **[BE] Land `DialecticBaseJobPayload` and the `isDialecticBaseJobPayload` guard family, and re-base `DialecticCompressJobPayload` on it — inheriting `user_jwt`, `idempotencyKey` and `source_prompt_resource_id`, declaring no `job_type` and no `user_id`**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/enqueueRenderJob/enqueueRenderJob.ts **[BE] Re-base `DialecticRenderCompressedContextJobPayload` on `DialecticBaseJobPayload` and delegate its guard to the base guard for every inherited member**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/enqueueModelCall/enqueueModelCall.ts **[BE] Remove `output_type` from `EnqueueModelCallParams`, from `isEnqueueModelCallParams`, and the admission gate over it — nothing names an artifact type at dispatch**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/compressPrompt/compressPrompt.ts **[BE] Carry the victim scorer as an injected collaborator on `CompressPromptDeps` rather than as data on `CompressPromptPayload`**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/calculateAffordability/calculateAffordability.ts **[BE] Separate affordability from compression: no `compressPrompt` dep, no `compressionStrategy` payload member, no pending or compressed return flavor**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/prepareModelJob/prepareModelJob.ts **[BE] Become the single model-call dispatcher: narrow with the base guard, compose `calculateAffordability` with `compressPrompt`, branch the recursion guard on the row's `job_type`, drop `sessionData`/`authToken`, and write `source_prompt_resource_id` onto the job payload before enqueue**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processSimpleJob.ts **[BE] Drop `compressionStrategy` from its `PrepareModelJobPayload` literal and `sessionData`/`authToken` from its `PrepareModelJobParams` literal**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/_shared/prompt-assembler/prompt-assembler.ts **[BE] Return `AssembledPrompt | AssembleContinuationPromptErrorReturn` from `BoundAssembleContinuationPromptFn` and the `IPromptAssembler` method it fronts, so both prompt members agree**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/continueJob.ts **[BE] Make `IContinueJobResult` a discriminated union with enqueued, continuation-limit and error arms; its COMPRESS payload literal carries no `job_type`**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processCompressJob/processCompressJob.ts **[BE] Compose a `PromptConstructionPayload` from the assembled prompt and call `prepareModelJob`; own no part of the model call, and narrow both assembly unions before use**

* `[ ]`   supabase/migrations/20260804163845_compression_prompt_provenance.sql **[DB] Add `dialectic_project_resources.source_prompt_resource_id` with its self-referencing FK, mirroring the `dialectic_contributions` column; regenerate `types_db.ts`**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/_shared/services/file_manager.ts **[BE] Write `source_prompt_resource_id` on both artifact-table inserts under one column name; `ResourceUploadContext` gains `sourcePromptResourceId`**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/_shared/utils/buildUploadContext/buildUploadContext.ts **[BE] Set `sourcePromptResourceId` on the resource arm's `ResourceUploadContext`, from the same-named member on `BuildUploadContextResourceParams`**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/index.ts **[BE] Bind the victim scorer into `compressPrompt`'s deps at the worker composition root**

## WS-S — saveResponse DECOMPOSITION + COMPRESS RESPONSE PERSISTENCE (depends WS-J; gates WS-D)

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/assembleAiResponse/assembleAiResponse.ts **[BE] Pure `UnifiedAIResponse` assembly — token-usage synthesis, finish-reason narrowing, raw-provider composition, and caller-supplied `processingTimeMs`**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/loadJobContext/loadJobContext.ts **[BE] The job, provider and session reads with the base-payload member census, returning the job row, provider row, validated config and owner id**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/prepareResponseContent/prepareResponseContent.ts **[BE] The retry conditions, the sanitize → parse sequence, and the repo's only `determineContinuation` call — owning `sourceObject`, and passing a text-mode response through unparsed**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/debitForResponse/debitForResponse.ts **[BE] The wallet read, validations and `debitTokens` call, hoisted ahead of every decision that can still reject the job, so the ledger matches the invoice**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/resolveContributionIdentity/resolveContributionIdentity.ts **[BE] EXECUTE-only identity resolution narrowed through `isDialecticExecuteJobPayload`, propagating its thrown diagnostic unchanged onto the error arm**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/persistContributionRelationships/persistContributionRelationships.ts **[BE] The continuation and init-and-merge branches with both `dialectic_contributions` updates, returning the updated contribution row rather than mutating one**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/finalizeContributionJob/finalizeContributionJob.ts **[BE] The RENDER dispatch, notifications, continuation, final-document assembly and job-row completion, with `FinalizeContributionJobUpdateError` and no prompt-resource back-link**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/saveContributionResponse/saveContributionResponse.ts **[BE] The EXECUTE arm composing identity resolution, the contribution upload, relationship persistence and finalization**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/saveCompressedResponse/saveCompressedResponse.ts **[BE] The COMPRESS arm: a continuation gate on `shouldContinue` alone for both modes, idempotent `CompressedContextRawJson` persistence, a RENDER dispatch plus `waiting_for_children` for a renderable source, and the extracted `CompressedContext` write for a text source**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/saveResponse.ts **[BE] The relocation node: a thin orchestrator routing on the row's `job_type` with `SaveResponseDeps` unchanged, `SaveResponseSuccessReturn['status']` gaining `waiting_for_children`, and the monolith body deleted**

## WS-D — COMPRESSION ORCHESTRATION CUTOVER (depends WS-S)

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/retryJob/retryJob.ts **[BE] Canonicalize the retry dispatcher as a function-folder module whose success arm carries the notified and unnotified flavors and whose error arm carries `RetryJobUpdateError`, so neither failure mode is lost**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/saveResponse/prepareResponseContent/prepareResponseContent.ts **[BE] Narrow the canonical `retryJob` union at the repo's single retry call site, carrying a notification error onward to the orchestrator**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/applyCompressionOverlay/applyCompressionOverlay.ts **[BE] Forward canonical-path lookup per candidate, swapping compressed content into resource documents and history messages without mutating inputs and without a deconstructor dep**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/gatherArtifacts/gatherArtifacts.ts **[BE] Inject `applyCompressionOverlay` post-gather with the `stageSlug` and `targetKey` its lookup requires, and tighten `ResourceDocument.type` to `'resource' | 'feedback' | 'system'` across all five push sites**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/_shared/utils/vector_utils.ts **[BE] Embedding-free selection: `effectiveScore = candidateTokens × importance`, system-typed documents excluded from the candidate pool, and `getEmbedding`/`embeddingClient`/`cosineSimilarity` deleted**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/compressPrompt/compressPrompt.ts **[BE] Full rewrite as an artifact-existence-driven machine: overlay on entry, reduce check for chunked victims, select and spawn ONE victim with a pending success, recount and return the working set when it fits**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/calculateAffordability/calculateAffordability.ts **[BE] Real `tokenizerDeps`, so one ruler measures the preflight, the per-victim target, scoring and chunk sizing; `isUserConfig` authored once in the owner's guard file and exported from its provides**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/prepareModelJob/prepareModelJob.ts **[BE] Thread `parentJob`, `projectId`, `iterationNumber` and `targetKey` into `CompressPromptParams` on the EXECUTE branch, and propagate the deferral as `PrepareModelJobPendingReturn`**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/chat/streamChat/StreamChat.ts **[BE] Replace the character-indexing `getEncoding` and `text.length` `countTokensAnthropic` with the real implementations behind `tokensRequiredForStreaming`**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/chat/streamRewind/streamRewind.ts **[BE] The same replacement behind `tokensRequiredForRewind`, after which no production source constructs a character-indexing tokenizer**

* `[ ]`   supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/index.ts **[BE] Bind `applyCompressionOverlay` and add it to `boundGatherArtifacts`'s deps at the worker composition root**

## WS-X — RAG REMOVAL (shares WS-D's commit)

WS-D severed every live functional reference into the RAG core; this closes it out by deleting it. No full nodes — deletions and reference cleanup only.

### DELETE (whole file)
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/_shared/services/rag_service.ts`
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/_shared/services/rag_service.interface.ts`
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/_shared/services/rag_service.mock.ts`
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/_shared/services/rag_service.test.ts`
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/_shared/services/indexing_service.ts`
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/_shared/services/indexing_service.interface.ts`
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/_shared/services/indexing_service.mock.ts`
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/_shared/services/indexing_service.test.ts`

### EDIT (remove dead `RagService`/`IndexingService`/`EmbeddingClient` construction, imports, and fields — `listCodeUsages` at implementation time to catch anything missed below)
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/index.ts` — the epic's SECOND and FINAL touch to this file. Remove: imports (`:32-33`); `embeddingClient`/`textSplitter`/`indexingService`/`ragService` construction (`:103-108`); their inclusion in whatever deps object passes them onward (`:172-174`); rewrite the bound `compressPrompt` closure (`:193`, currently `compressPrompt({ logger, ragService, embeddingClient, tokenWalletService: adminTokenWalletService, countTokens }, ...)`) to the shape `compressPrompt.ts`'s node already established (`applyCompressionOverlay`, `enqueueCompressJobs`, `fileManager`, `constructStoragePath`, `downloadFromStorage`, `countTokens`, `logger` — no `ragService`/`embeddingClient`/`tokenWalletService`).
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/createJobContext/JobContext.interface.ts` — remove the `IRagService`/`IIndexingService`/`IEmbeddingClient` import (`:7-9`) and the `ragService`/`indexingService`/`embeddingClient` fields from every interface that carries them (`:184-186`, `:222-223`, `:296-298`, `:335-337`).
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/createJobContext/JobContext.mock.ts` — remove the corresponding mock field construction.
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/createJobContext/JobContext.guard.test.ts` — remove assertions on the deleted fields.
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/createJobContext/createJobContext.interface.test.ts` — remove fixture fields/stubs for the deleted interface members.
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/dialectic.interface.ts` — remove the `IEmbeddingClient`/`IIndexingService` import (`:10-12`) and the `indexingService`/`embeddingClient` fields (`:1791-1792`).
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/_shared/utils/errors.ts` — remove the now-dead `RagServiceError` class (`:16-19`).
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/index.test.ts` — remove any fixture/mock construction of the deleted services.
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processComplexJob.happy.test.ts`, `processComplexJob.errors.test.ts`, `processComplexJob.parallel.test.ts` — remove `ragService`/`embeddingClient`/`indexingService` from any `IJobContext`-shaped fixture they construct.
* `[ ]`   `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/dialectic-worker.md` — remove or update prose referencing the RAG compression path.
* `[ ]`   Every test file already rewritten by an earlier WS-D node (`compressPrompt.test.ts`/`.integration.test.ts`, `calculateAffordability.integration.test.ts`, `prepareModelJob.test.ts`/`.integration.test.ts`, `vector_utils.test.ts`, `dialectic.interface.ts`'s `compressPrompt.interface.ts`/`.mock.ts`) is NOT touched again here — those nodes already removed their own `ragService`/`embeddingClient`/`IEmbeddingClient` references; re-verify only, do not re-edit.

### Migration
* `[ ]`   New migration `supabase/migrations/<ts>_compression_jobs_remove_rag.sql` — the epic's REMOVE migration (paired with the WS-0 ADD migration; exactly two migrations for the whole epic):
  ```sql
  drop function if exists public.match_dialectic_chunks(vector, double precision, integer, uuid);
  drop table if exists public.dialectic_memory;
  ```
  (confirm the exact `match_dialectic_chunks` argument signature against its defining migration before writing the `drop function` line — Postgres requires the exact signature to resolve overloads).
* `[ ]`   Regenerate `supabase/functions/types_db.ts` — by this point in the sprint nothing references `dialectic_memory` or `match_dialectic_chunks` (WS-D's `vector_utils.ts` node already deleted the last live query against `dialectic_memory`), so the regeneration is a pure drop with no compile fallout.

### Commit
* `[ ]`   **Commit** `feat(dialectic): job-driven schema-targeted compression replaces synchronous RAG`
  * Structural: `COMPRESS` job type + compression prompt template (WS-0); `CompressedContext` artifact identity + path support (WS-C); COMPRESS routing, spawn, and dedup machinery (WS-R); renderer module extraction, relocation and RENDER dispatch (WS-B, WS-N); compression source identity (WS-I); COMPRESS continuation and prompt provenance (WS-P); one job-payload base and one model-call dispatcher (WS-J); `saveResponse` decomposed with COMPRESS persistence (WS-S); compression orchestration cutover in `gatherArtifacts`/`compressPrompt`/`calculateAffordability`/`prepareModelJob`/`processSimpleJob` (WS-D); `rag_service`/`indexing_service`/`dialectic_memory`/`match_dialectic_chunks` deleted (WS-X).
  * Behavioral: oversized model-call inputs compress incrementally via job-driven COMPRESS children instead of a synchronous embedding-based RAG call; compressed artifacts persist with real wallet attribution and are reused across sibling jobs targeting the same schema; no synchronous model or embedding call remains anywhere in Supabase.
  * Contract: `ResourceDocument.type`/`CompressionSourceType`/`CompressionMode` govern all compression-artifact identity; `CalculateAffordabilityReturn`/`PrepareModelJobReturn` each gained a `Pending` variant that propagates a paused job cleanly to `processSimpleJob`.

# To-Do List

* **Subscription checkout deep links — prepopulate cart from upgrade and top-up CTAs**

  Implement after the **Dynamic cost ceiling** ticket above. Cost ceiling supplies `stage_ceiling`, `project_ceiling`, and token shortfalls for NSF and pre-project surfaces; this ticket wires every `/subscription` CTA to the cart using those values (where applicable) plus tier-aware plan resolution for feature-gate upgrades. Do this in **one pass** once `selectCostCeiling` / `selectPreProjectCostCeiling` exist — do not ship another round of naked `/subscription` links.

  ### Problem

  Multiple tickets (FE Ticket 1 dashboard/sidebar, FE2 model selector gating, FE3 output-cap slider and cost-ceiling NSF) added upgrade and top-up CTAs that navigate to `/subscription` with no cart context. The user lands on the subscription page and must manually find the right plan or token pack. The original FE plan (**Multi-item checkout cart**, now implemented) specified `prefillCart`, URL query params (`?plan=` / `?otp=`), and CTA consumers — but consumers were left as placeholders (`Link to="/subscription"` or `navigate("/subscription")`).

  ### What already exists (no reinvention)

  - **`packages/store/src/cartStore/cartStore.ts`**: `prefillCart({ subscriptionPlanId?, otpPlanIds? })` clears the cart, resolves plans from `useSubscriptionStore.getState().availablePlans` by `plan.id` or `plan.stripe_price_id`, then populates `subscriptionItem` / `otpItems`.
  - **`apps/web/src/pages/Subscription.tsx`**: On load, if `?plan=` or `?otp=` query params are present and `availablePlans` is loaded, calls `prefillCart` and clears params from the URL (`setSearchParams({}, { replace: true })`).
  - **Cart checkout**: `checkoutCart()` builds multi-item `PurchaseRequest` and redirects to Stripe.

  **Gaps in existing infrastructure:**
  - No shared helper maps **tier level** or **token shortfall** → plan IDs; each CTA would duplicate lookup logic.
  - `prefillCart` does not match `item_id_internal` (only `id` and `stripe_price_id`); extend if production plans are keyed internally.
  - Subscription page tabs (`monthly` / `annual` / `top-up`) are local state only; NSF/top-up CTAs need **`?tab=top-up`** (or equivalent) read on mount so the Top-Up tab is visible after navigation.

  ### Resolution helpers (new — shared by all CTAs)

  Add a small pure module (location TBD during node planning — e.g. `apps/web/src/utils/subscriptionCta.ts`) that operates on `SubscriptionPlan[]` from `availablePlans`:

  1. **`subscriptionPlanForTierLevel(targetLevel, plans, preferInterval?)`**
     - Filter: `plan_type === 'subscription'`, `active`, `tier_level === targetLevel`, exclude free/zero-amount plans.
     - Prefer monthly vs annual by name or interval when multiple plans share a tier (default: monthly).
     - Return `SubscriptionPlan | null` (use `.id` in URLs and `prefillCart`).

  2. **`smallestOtpPlanForShortfall(shortfallTokens, plans)`**
     - Filter: `plan_type === 'one_time_purchase'`, `tokens_to_award` not null.
     - Sort ascending by `tokens_to_award`; return first plan where `tokens_to_award >= shortfallTokens`.

  3. **`buildSubscriptionCtaUrl(intent)`** (or equivalent)
     - Inputs: `{ subscriptionPlanId?: string; otpPlanIds?: string[]; tab?: 'top-up' }`.
     - Output: `/subscription?plan=...&otp=...&tab=top-up` with repeated `otp` params when needed.
     - Use **runtime plan UUIDs** from `availablePlans` — do not hardcode doc examples like `premium-monthly`.

  CTAs may use **URL-only** deep links (preferred for `<Link>`) or **prefillCart + navigate** for buttons; URL prefill on `SubscriptionPage` must remain the single source of truth on arrival so refresh and shared links work.

  ### CTA inventory — current naked links and intended prefill

  **Tier / feature-gate upgrades (subscription plan only)**

  | Surface | File | Trigger | Prefill |
  |--------|------|---------|---------|
  | Tier-locked model | `AIModelSelector.tsx` | `min_plan_tier_level > userTier.level` | `plan` = subscription for `provider.min_plan_tier_level` |
  | Model-count cap | `AIModelSelector.tsx` | at cap on multiplicity | `plan` = subscription for tier from `resolveNextTierName` → that tier's `level` |
  | Tier-locked row | `AIModelSelectorList.tsx` | same as selector | same |
  | Count-cap row | `AIModelSelectorList.tsx` | same | same |
  | Output cap upgrade | `OutputCapSlider.tsx` | locked marker / drag past thumb max | `plan` = subscription for tier matching `upgradeTargetName` (`availableTiers` by name → `level`) |

  **Account / navigation (tier upgrade or browse)**

  | Surface | File | Trigger | Prefill |
  |--------|------|---------|---------|
  | Plan card | `Dashboard.tsx` | `nextTierName` | `plan` = next tier's `level` |
  | Plan card fallback | `Dashboard.tsx` | `userTier === null` | no plan (generic `/subscription`) |
  | Quick action "Upgrade" | `Dashboard.tsx` | marketing | next tier `plan`, or OTP-only if product decides ultra users need tokens only |
  | Sidebar upgrade | `nav-user.tsx` | `nextTierName` | same as dashboard |
  | Sidebar "Billing" | `nav-user.tsx` | manage billing | no prefill (portal on page) |
  | Profile | `Profile.tsx` | "Manage subscription" | no prefill |
  | Header / Help / Pricing (logged in) | `Header.tsx`, `Help.tsx`, `PricingPage.tsx` | browse | no prefill |

  **Token top-up (OTP only — often `tab=top-up`)**

  | Surface | File | Trigger | Prefill |
  |--------|------|---------|---------|
  | Wallet | `WalletBalanceDisplay.tsx` | "Purchase Tokens" | optional smallest OTP or none; `tab=top-up` |
  | Generate callout | `GenerateContributionButton.tsx` | wallet below stage `minimum_balance` | `otp` = pack covering `stageThreshold - balance` (interim until cost ceiling ships) |
  | Session NSF (this ticket + cost ceiling) | `DialecticSessionDetailsPage.tsx`, `GenerateContributionButton` / session controls | `stage_ceiling > wallet_balance` | `otp` = `smallestOtpPlanForShortfall(stage_ceiling - wallet_balance)`; `tab=top-up` |
  | Project warning (cost ceiling) | session / `SessionInfoCard.tsx` | `project_ceiling > wallet_balance` | `otp` for `project_ceiling - wallet_balance`; informational, do not block create |
  | Pre-project autostart (cost ceiling) | `CreateDialecticProjectForm.tsx` | first-stage `stage_ceiling > wallet` | same OTP shortfall for first stage; disable Autostart, allow Create |

  **Dual intent (upgrade + top-up):** When a surface needs both a higher tier and tokens (e.g. locked premium model with insufficient wallet for estimated run), pass both `plan` and `otp` in one URL. FE cart ticket Pattern 1 applies.

  ### Implementation sequence (single pass, after cost ceiling)

  1. **Cost ceiling** — `@paynless/utils` `computeCostCeiling`, selector-derived ceilings, UI hooks for estimates and shortfalls (per Dynamic cost ceiling ticket above).
  2. **Subscription CTA helpers** — `subscriptionPlanForTierLevel`, `smallestOtpPlanForShortfall`, `buildSubscriptionCtaUrl`; unit tests with `SubscriptionPlan` fixtures from `PlanCard.mock.ts`.
  3. **`Subscription.tsx`** — honor `?tab=top-up` on mount (set `activeTab`); optionally extend `prefillCart` lookup to `item_id_internal`.
  4. **Wire all CTAs** in one change set: replace naked `to="/subscription"` / `navigate("/subscription")` with URLs from helpers; dialectic components first (`AIModelSelector`, `AIModelSelectorList`, `OutputCapSlider`, `GenerateContributionButton`, `CreateDialecticProjectForm`, session page / `SessionInfoCard`), then account surfaces (`Dashboard`, `nav-user`, `WalletBalanceDisplay`).
  5. **Tests** — update existing tests that assert `href === '/subscription'` to assert query strings when prefill applies; add helper unit tests.

  ### Known files in dependency order

  **Helpers (new):**
  1. `packages/store/src/subscriptionCta.ts` (new) — plan resolution and URL builder (or `apps/web/src/utils/subscriptionCta.ts` if web-only; prefer store package if dialectic store will import shortfall helpers)
  2. `packages/store/src/subscriptionCta.test.ts` (new)

  **Subscription page:**
  3. `apps/web/src/pages/Subscription.tsx` — `?tab=` query handling; confirm prefill runs after `loadSubscriptionData`
  4. `apps/web/src/pages/Subscription.test.tsx` — tab param + combined `plan` + `otp` prefill

  **Optional cart store:**
  5. `packages/store/src/cartStore/cartStore.ts` — optional `item_id_internal` in `prefillCart` lookup

  **No prefill required (leave generic `/subscription` or document explicitly):**
  - `Profile.tsx`, `Header.tsx`, `Help.tsx`, `PricingPage.tsx`, `nav-user` Billing button

  ### Dependencies

  - **Depends on Dynamic cost ceiling** (same FE3 doc): OTP shortfalls for NSF, pre-project autostart, and project-level warnings require `costCeilingEstimate` / `stage_ceiling` / `project_ceiling`. Tier-only CTAs (model lock, output cap, dashboard upgrade) can be implemented with helpers alone but should ship in the same pass to avoid duplicate churn.
  - **Depends on FE cart ticket (complete)**: `cartStore`, `Subscription.tsx` URL prefill, multi-item checkout.
  - **Depends on Ticket 1**: `userTier`, `availableTiers`, `availablePlans` / `loadSubscriptionData`.
  - **Depends on Output clamp slider (complete)**: `maxOutputTokens` for cost ceiling `output_cap` input.
  - **Ops (deferred)**: `subscription_plans.tier_level` must match `tier_definitions.level` in production data for `subscriptionPlanForTierLevel` to resolve correctly (see Stripe plans ops task below).

  ### Scope split — FE vs BE

  FE-only. No BE changes unless plan catalog fetch is incomplete before navigation (ensure `loadSubscriptionData` runs for authenticated users hitting deep links).

  ### Open questions for node planning

  1. **Helper package location:** `packages/store` (shared with dialectic recompute) vs `apps/web` only?
  2. **Billing interval preference:** Default monthly for tier upgrades, or infer from `userSubscription` / current plan?
  3. **Ultra users on Dashboard quick action:** Next tier is null — link to top-up tab only, or hide?
  4. **GenerateContributionButton:** Retain `minimum_balance` shortfall until cost ceiling is wired on session page, then unify on `stage_ceiling` shortfall.
  5. **Bundle cards** (FE cart ticket §E): Optional follow-up — static bundle config calling same `prefillCart` / URL builder; not required for CTA pass.



## Netlify-Worker-Stream Phase 2 and Phase 3 — deferred detail

### Phase 2 (backend notification and status adaptation):

* getAllStageProgress.ts and its consumers need to understand queued as a distinct in-flight status (currently it would fall through to an unclassified state)
* The notification service needs updated event types for the new async lifecycle (stream_queued, stream_started, stream_complete) to give the frontend accurate real-time signals
* deriveStepStatuses and related step-progress logic need to account for jobs in queued state without treating them as failed or not-started

### Phase 3 (frontend):

* Status display components consuming UnifiedStageStatus need a new streaming or queued visual state
* Real-time subscription handlers need to act on the new job status transitions
* The user-facing progress indicators need to reflect the two-phase async lifecycle rather than a single blocking operation


## StageDAGProgressDialog does not color nodes correctly, probably relies on explicit hydration instead of dynamic hydration from notifications
- Update StageDAGProgressDialog to use notifications to change color too 

## Highlight the chosen Chat or Project in the left sidebar 
- Currently the sidebar gives no indication of which Chat or Project the user has focused
- Outline and/or highlight the chosen Chat or Project in the left sidebar

## New user sign in banner doesn't display, throws console error  
- Chase, diagnose, fix 

## Refactor EMCAS to break apart the functions, segment out the tests
- Move gatherArtifacts call to processSimpleJob
- Decide where to measure & RAG

## Switch to stream-to-buffer instead of chunking
- This lets us render the buffer in real time to show document progress 

## Build test fixtures for major function groups 
- Provide standard mock factories and objects 
- dialectic-worker, dialectic-service, document_renderer, anything else that has huge test files  

## Support user-provided API keys for their preferred providers 

## Regenerate existing document from user feedback & edits 

## Have an additional user input panel where they user can build their own hybrid versions from the ones provided 
AND/OR
## Let the user pick/rate their preferred version and drop the others 

## Use a gentle color schema to differentiate model outputs visually / at a glance 

## When doc loads for the first time, position at top 

## Search across documents for key terms 

## Collect user satisfaction evaluation after each generation "How would you feel if you couldn't use this again?" 

## Add optional outputs for selected stages
- A "landing page" output for the proposal stage
-- Landing page
-- Hero banner
-- Call to action
-- Email sign up 
- A "financial analysis" output for the "refinement" stage
-- 1/3/5 year 
-- Conservative / base / aggressive
-- IS, BS, CF 
- A "generate next set of work" for the implementation stage 

## Front end hydration problems
- n/n Done does not up date real, only on refresh
- SubmitResponsesButton does not appear when docs are done 
- "Review" stage does not reliably advance 

## Fix continuation naming to use continuation naming instead of iterations
