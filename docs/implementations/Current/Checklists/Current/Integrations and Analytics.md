# Integrations and Analytics. 

## Problem Statement
- The application provides ExportProject for a zip file.
- Users have to manually extract the desired files and move them to their consumption site.
- The application needs to have native integration for popular repo and project platforms. 
- Analytics are bare-bones and most user interactions are not collected. 

## Objectives
- Github integration for exporting plans to repos. 
- Site builder integration for beginning projects. 
-- Bolt.new
-- Lovable.dev
-- v0
-- Replit
- Rich analytics that collect data on all user interaction touchpoints in the app. 

## Expected Outcome
- Users can sync their plans to their repo.
- Users can immediately launch a project using the plans. 
- All user interactions in the UI are collected and analyzed. 


## Instructions for Agent
*   You MUST read the file every time you need to touch it. YOU CAN NOT RELY ON YOUR "MEMORY" of having read a file at some point previously. YOU MUST READ THE FILE FROM DISK EVERY TIME! 
*   You MUST read the file BEFORE YOU TRY TO EDIT IT. Your edit WILL NOT APPLY if you do not read the file. 
*   To edit a file, READ the file so you have its state. EDIT the file precisely, ONLY changing EXACTLY what needs modified and nothing else. Then READ the file to ensure the change applied. 
*   DO NOT rewrite files or refactor functions unless explicitly instructed to. 
*   DO NOT write to a file you aren't explicitly instructed to edit. 
*   We use strict explicit typing everywhere, always. 
    * There are only two exceptions: 
        * We cannot strictly type Supabase clients
        * When we test graceful error handling, we often need to pass in malformed objects that must be typecast to pass linting to permit testing of improperly shaped objects. 
*   We only edit a SINGLE FILE at a time. We NEVER edit multiple files in one turn.
*   We do EXACTLY what the instruction in the checklist step says without exception.
*   If we cannot perform the step as described or make a discovery, we explain the problem or discovery and HALT! We DO NOT CONTINUE after we encounter a problem or a discovery.
*   We DO NOT CONTINUE if we encounter a problem or make a discovery. We explain the problem or discovery then halt for user input. 
*   If our discovery is that more files need to be edited, instead of editing a file, we generate a proposal for a checklist of instructions to insert into the work plan that explains everything required to update the codebase so that the invalid step can be resolved. 
*   DO NOT RUMINATE ON HOW TO SOLVE A PROBLEM OR DISCOVERY WHILE ONLY EDITING ONE FILE! That is a DISCOVERY that requires that you EXPLAIN your discovery, PROPOSE a solution, and HALT! 
*   We always use test-driven-development. 
    *   We write a RED test that we expect to fail to prove the flaw or incomplete code. 
        *   A RED test is written to the INTENDED SUCCESS STATE so that it is NOT edited again. Do NOT refer to "RED: x condition now, y condition later", which forces the test to be edited after the GREEN step. Do NOT title the test to include any reference to RED/GREEN. Tests are stateless. 
        *   We implement the edit to a SINGLE FILE to enable the GREEN state.
        *   We run the test again and prove it passes. We DO NOT edit the test unless we discover the test is itself flawed. 
*   EVERY EDIT is performed using TDD. We DO NOT EDIT ANY FILE WITHOUT A TEST. 
    *   Documents, types, and interfaces cannot be tested, so are exempt. 
*   Every edit is documented in the checklist of instructions that describe the required edits. 
*   Whenever we discover an edit must be made that is not documented in the checklist of instructions, we EXPLAIN the discovery, PROPOSE an insertion into the instruction set that describes the required work, and HALT. 
    *   We build dependency ordered instructions so that the dependencies are built, tested, and working before the consumers of the dependency. 
*   We use dependency injection for EVERY FILE. 
*   We build adapters and interfaces for EVERY FUNCTION.  
*   We edit files from the lowest dependency on the tree up to the top so that our tests can be run at every step.
*   We PROVE tests pass before we move to the next file. We NEVER proceed without explicit demonstration that the tests pass. 
*   The tests PROVE the functional gap, PROVE the flaw in the function, and prevent regression by ensuring that any changes MUST comply with the proof. 
*   Our process to edit a file is: 
    *   READ the instruction for the step, and read every file referenced by the instruction or step, or implicit by the instruction or step (like types and interfaces).
    *   ANALYZE the difference between the state of the file and the state described by the instructions in the step.
    *   EXPLAIN how the file must be edited to transform it from its current state into the state described by the instructions in the step. 
    *   PROPOSE an edit to the file that will accomplish the transformation while preserving strict explicit typing. 
    *   LINT! After editing the file, run your linter and fix all linter errors that are fixable within that single file. 
    *   HALT! After editing ONE file and ensuring it passes linting, HALT! DO NOT CONTINUE! 
*   The agent NEVER runs tests. 
*   The agent uses ITS OWN TOOLS. 
*   The agent DOES NOT USE THE USER'S TERMINAL. 

## Legend - You must use this EXACT format. Do not modify it, adapt it, or "improve" it. The bullets, square braces, ticks, nesting, and numbering are ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY and UNALTERABLE. 

*   `[ ]` 1. Unstarted work step. Each work step will be uniquely named for easy reference. We begin with 1.
    *   `[ ]` 1.a. Work steps will be nested as shown. Substeps use characters, as is typical with legal documents.
        *   `[ ]` 1. a. i. Nesting can be as deep as logically required, using roman numerals, according to standard legal document numbering processes.
*   `[‚úÖ]` Represents a completed step or nested set.
*   `[üöß]` Represents an incomplete or partially completed step or nested set.
*   `[‚è∏Ô∏è]` Represents a paused step where a discovery has been made that requires backtracking or further clarification.
*   `[‚ùì]` Represents an uncertainty that must be resolved before continuing.
*   `[üö´]` Represents a blocked, halted, or stopped step or has an unresolved problem or prior dependency to resolve before continuing.

## Component Types and Labels

The implementation plan uses the following labels to categorize work steps:

*   `[DB]` Database Schema Change (Migration)
*   `[RLS]` Row-Level Security Policy
*   `[BE]` Backend Logic (Edge Function / RLS / Helpers / Seed Data)
*   `[API]` API Client Library (`@paynless/api` - includes interface definition in `interface.ts`, implementation in `adapter.ts`, and mocks in `mocks.ts`)
*   `[STORE]` State Management (`@paynless/store` - includes interface definition, actions, reducers/slices, selectors, and mocks)
*   `[UI]` Frontend Component (e.g., in `apps/web`, following component structure rules)
*   `[CLI]` Command Line Interface component/feature
*   `[IDE]` IDE Plugin component/feature
*   `[TEST-UNIT]` Unit Test Implementation/Update
*   `[TEST-INT]` Integration Test Implementation/Update (API-Backend, Store-Component, RLS)
*   `[TEST-E2E]` End-to-End Test Implementation/Update
*   `[DOCS]` Documentation Update (READMEs, API docs, user guides)
*   `[REFACTOR]` Code Refactoring Step
*   `[PROMPT]` System Prompt Engineering/Management
*   `[CONFIG]` Configuration changes (e.g., environment variables, service configurations)
*   `[COMMIT]` Checkpoint for Git Commit (aligns with "feat:", "test:", "fix:", "docs:", "refactor:" conventions)
*   `[DEPLOY]` Checkpoint for Deployment consideration after a major phase or feature set is complete and tested.

[ ] 1. [PROMPT] Parenthesis: make prompts and stage recipe convergent
    [ ] a. [TEST-UNIT] Add failing tests in `supabase/functions/_shared/prompt-assembler.test.ts` proving Parenthesis prompts include a clear convergent directive to ‚Äúsynthesize a single, unified document from all relevant prior-stage context.‚Äù
        [ ] i. Assert assembled prompt includes both: (1) convergent directive language, (2) reference to using all prior-stage documents via the RAG pipeline.
    [ ] b. [DB/PROMPT] Migration/seed to update `system_prompts.prompt_text` for Parenthesis with explicit convergent instructions and the plan/checklist style guide.
    [ ] c. [BE] Update prompt assembly to inject Parenthesis convergent directive
        [ ] i. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/prompt-assembler.ts` (or the stage prompt assembly utility used by Parenthesis) to combine system prompt and convergent directive correctly.
    [ ] d. [TEST-INT] Add/extend `dialectic-service` integration test to assert the Parenthesis request carries the convergent directive and full prior-stage context when building the prompt.

[ ] 2. [PROMPT] Paralysis: make prompts and stage recipe convergent
    [ ] a. [TEST-UNIT] Add failing tests in `supabase/functions/_shared/prompt-assembler.test.ts` proving Paralysis prompts include a convergent directive AND the ‚ÄúFirst Mention, Full Implementation Prioritization‚Äù reordering rule.
        [ ] i. Assert assembled prompt includes: (1) convergent directive, (2) explicit dependency-driven reordering rule text referencing first-mention principle, (3) usage of all Parenthesis outputs via RAG.
    [ ] b. [DB/PROMPT] Migration/seed to update `system_prompts.prompt_text` for Paralysis with convergent instructions, reordering rule, and style guide.
    [ ] c. [BE] Update prompt assembly to inject Paralysis convergent directive and reordering instructions
        [ ] i. File: `supabase/functions/_shared/prompt-assembler.ts` (or the stage prompt assembly utility used by Paralysis).
    [ ] d. [TEST-INT] Add/extend `dialectic-service` integration test to assert the Paralysis request includes convergent + reordering directives and full Parenthesis context in the assembled prompt.

[ ] 3. [BE] Add optional ‚Äúadvisor‚Äù job users can run after any stage
    [ ] a. [TEST-UNIT] Add failing tests for enqueueing `advisor` on-demand
        [ ] i. File: `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/index.test.ts`
            - Action: `runAdvisor({ sessionId, stageSlug })` enqueues one `advisor` job with session/project context; DI respected.
            - RLS: only the session owner can enqueue.
    [ ] b. [BE] Implement enqueue in `supabase/functions/dialectic-service/index.ts`
        [ ] i. Handler `runAdvisor.ts` creates an `advisor` job for the given `{ sessionId, stageSlug }`.
    [ ] c. [TEST-UNIT] Add failing tests for `processAdvisorJob` worker in `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processAdvisorJob.test.ts`
        [ ] i. Asserts: gathers all contributions for `{ sessionId, stageSlug }` via RAG; calls model once (or batched if needed); writes comparison outputs.
    [ ] d. [BE] Implement `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/processAdvisorJob.ts`
        [ ] i. DI for storage/db/model; collect all stage outputs; generate:
            - `advisor_comparison_matrix.md`, `advisor_comparative_analysis.md`, `advisor_recommendations.md`, `advisor_selection_rationale.md`.
            - Save as `dialectic_contribution` records; return success metrics.
    [ ] e. [BE] Route new job type in `supabase/functions/dialectic-worker/index.ts`
        [ ] i. Add dispatcher branch for `'advisor'` ‚Üí `processAdvisorJob.ts`.
    [ ] f. [TEST-INT] Add/extend `supabase/integration_tests/services/dialectic_pipeline.integration.test.ts`
        [ ] i. After any stage, call `runAdvisor`; assert comparison docs created and surfaced in outputs.
    [ ] g. [UI] Add "Run Advisor" button after each stage‚Äôs results list
        [ ] i. Disabled during async; shows outputs inline upon completion.
    [ ] h. [DOCS] Update developer docs describing advisor purpose/output and where it appears in the UI.
    [ ] i. [‚ùì] [DB] If strict enums exist, ensure job-type includes `'advisor'`; add a contribution type for advisor artifacts as needed.
