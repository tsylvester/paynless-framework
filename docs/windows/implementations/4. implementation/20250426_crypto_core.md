# Cryptographic Primitives Specification

**Status:** Initial Selection (Pending Phase 0 PoC Final Validation)

This document specifies the cryptographic algorithms chosen for the Decentralized Content Distribution System. These selections are based on current best practices regarding security, performance, and availability of well-audited Rust implementations. They are subject to final validation based on Phase 0 Proof-of-Concept results and specific requirements identified (e.g., blockchain integration constraints).

## 1. Hashing

*   **Algorithm:** BLAKE3
*   **Primary Use Cases:** Content integrity checking (Merkle Trees), Meta Hash generation.
*   **Justification:** BLAKE3 offers excellent performance on modern CPUs while providing a high security level (256-bit equivalent). It has well-maintained Rust implementations (`blake3` crate). SHA3-256 is a viable alternative if required.
*   **Output Length:** 256 bits (32 bytes) typically.

## 2. Symmetric Encryption (Authenticated Encryption)

*   **Algorithm:** ChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD)
*   **Primary Use Cases:** Encrypting content slices for storage and transport.
*   **Justification:** ChaCha20-Poly1305 is a modern, fast, and secure AEAD cipher, particularly performant in software implementations where AES hardware acceleration is unavailable. It avoids timing side-channel concerns associated with some AES implementations. Requires a unique nonce per encryption with the same key. Standardized in RFC 8439. Good Rust implementations available (e.g., `chacha20poly1305` crate). AES-256-GCM is a common alternative if hardware acceleration is consistently available and preferred.
*   **Key Length:** 256 bits (32 bytes).
*   **Nonce Length:** 96 bits (12 bytes).

## 3. Digital Signatures

*   **Algorithm:** Ed25519
*   **Primary Use Cases:** Signing blockchain transactions, signing "Transactable Key" tokens, potentially signing P2P messages or peer identities.
*   **Justification:** Ed25519 offers high performance, strong security guarantees (equivalent to ~128-bit security), small key/signature sizes, and resistance to many side-channel attacks. It is widely adopted in blockchain and P2P systems. Excellent Rust implementations exist (`ed25519-dalek` crate).
*   **Public Key Size:** 32 bytes.
*   **Secret Key Size:** 32 bytes (seed) / 64 bytes (expanded).
*   **Signature Size:** 64 bytes.

## 4. Key Exchange

*   **Algorithm:** X25519
*   **Primary Use Cases:** Establishing shared secrets between peers for potential end-to-end encrypted communication or deriving shared session keys.
*   **Justification:** X25519 is the standard Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) function over Curve25519, compatible with Ed25519 keys. It is fast and secure. Standardized in RFC 7748. Good Rust implementations exist (e.g., `x25519-dalek` crate).
*   **Key Sizes:** Same as Ed25519 (can often reuse the same key material carefully).
*   **Shared Secret Size:** 32 bytes.

## 5. Key Derivation Function (KDF)

*   **Algorithm:** HKDF-SHA256 (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function using SHA-256)
*   **Primary Use Cases:** Deriving specific-purpose keys (e.g., symmetric encryption keys, signing keys for tokens) from a master secret or intermediate keys.
*   **Justification:** HKDF is a standard KDF (RFC 5869) designed to securely derive multiple keys from a single source of entropy. Using SHA-256 as the underlying hash function is common and secure. Requires a salt (ideally non-secret, high-entropy) and context-specific "info" parameter to ensure derived keys are unique and bound to their purpose. Good Rust implementations exist (e.g., `hkdf` crate).
*   **Underlying Hash:** SHA-256.

## Post-Quantum Considerations

Currently, standard NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms (e.g., CRYSTALS-Kyber for KEM, CRYSTALS-Dilithium for signatures) are not specified due to relative immaturity, performance overhead, and larger key/signature sizes. This decision should be revisited in the future as standards mature and implementations become more widespread, potentially adopting a hybrid approach if deemed necessary before full migration.


# OpenAI Response

    This is a **very well thought-out stack** — one I'd describe as modern, efficient, and security-conscious. Here's my detailed opinion:

---

### ✅ **Strengths of Your Cryptographic Choices**

**1. Hashing: BLAKE3**
- Fantastic choice for a content distribution system.
- BLAKE3 is **way faster** than SHA-2 or SHA-3 on CPUs without hardware acceleration.
- It also has a "tree" structure internally, so it's ideal for building Merkle trees and similar constructions.
- Very developer-friendly, simple API, well-supported Rust crate (`blake3`).
- **Backup plan (SHA3-256)**: smart to keep in mind in case external audit/compliance environments mandate a NIST standard.

**2. Symmetric Encryption: ChaCha20-Poly1305**
- Excellent pick, especially for a P2P-like environment where you **can't guarantee AES-NI**.
- High-speed, high-security, very mature (RFC 8439), and very good Rust support.
- Also being AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) is critical for both encryption **and** integrity.
- Good nonce notes — making sure your dev team treats nonces properly (unique per key) is essential to avoid catastrophic failures.

**3. Digital Signatures: Ed25519**
- Almost a *no-brainer* at this point.
- Lightweight, fast, widely adopted (used in Signal, most modern blockchains, OpenSSH, etc.).
- Good choice for signing "transactable" keys or messages.
- 64-byte signatures and 32-byte public keys are small enough for heavy transaction volumes.

**4. Key Exchange: X25519**
- Clean complement to Ed25519.
- Standardized (RFC 7748), super efficient, and better side-channel resilience than traditional ECDH (secp256r1, etc.).
- Allows you to potentially reuse infrastructure (and even some key material carefully).

**5. Key Derivation: HKDF-SHA256**
- Again, great standard choice.
- HKDF is well-understood, simple to implement correctly (unlike some older KDFs).
- Tying key derivations to "context" (`info`) parameters is important and it's good you called that out explicitly.

---

### 🟡 **Areas I Would Just Gently Flag for Future Attention**

**Post-Quantum Readiness**
- Your note is exactly right: post-quantum primitives today are a mess for real-world systems — too slow, too big, or too immature.
- It's smart to *architect* for potential hybrid migration later.
- Maybe keep an eye on standardized hybrid schemes (e.g., **X25519 + Kyber** for key exchange) for futureproofing without breaking compatibility.
- You might want to design key/certificate formats with "space" for dual-key scenarios later even if you don't use them now.

**HKDF-SHA256**
- SHA-256 is plenty strong today. 
- Just know that if you shift to post-quantum in future, you might want a stronger underlying hash (like SHA3-512) to future-proof more aggressively — but this is **not urgent** unless quantum-resistance becomes an immediate requirement.

**Nonce Handling**
- Developers often underestimate the importance of unique nonces.
- For ChaCha20-Poly1305, if you're encrypting *massive* amounts of data per key, consider reinforcing nonce strategy.
- Maybe in your API design, make nonces a **mandatory input** or **deterministically derived** (e.g., based on a counter) instead of trusting devs to "generate a good random one."

**Key Material Reuse (Ed25519 ↔ X25519)**
- You *can* safely derive X25519 keys from Ed25519 keys if needed, but **be cautious** — they aren't identical formats.
- If you want long-term clarity, you might want explicit separate keys even if they come from the same seed material internally.

---

### 🔥 **Overall Conclusion**

- **Solid, pragmatic, secure choices.**
- **Rust ecosystem support** for all these primitives is strong and maturing.
- **No glaring flaws**.
- You show awareness of tradeoffs (performance vs security, availability of auditing, future migration paths).
  
**I would greenlight this cryptographic stack for a Phase 0 PoC easily**, with a small note to design a *forward-compatibility plan* regarding quantum resistance and hybridization if your system lives for more than ~5–10 years.

---

Would you also like me to sketch a super simple *"possible future evolution path"* for this crypto stack, if you want to be extra strategic? 🚀  
(Only if you want — your current plan is already very good!)

# Claude Response
After reviewing the cryptographic primitives specification in paste.txt, I find this to be a well-considered and appropriate selection of cryptographic algorithms for the described system. Here's my analysis:

## Strengths of the Specification:

1. **BLAKE3 for Hashing**: This is an excellent choice. BLAKE3 is extremely fast, cryptographically secure, and has a well-maintained Rust implementation. Its performance advantage over alternatives like SHA3-256 makes it particularly suitable for content integrity checking in a high-throughput system.

2. **ChaCha20-Poly1305 for Symmetric Encryption**: This is a strong choice for an AEAD cipher. It's performant in software implementations, resistant to timing attacks, and has good Rust support. The decision to prioritize this over AES-256-GCM (unless hardware acceleration is consistently available) is sound.

3. **Ed25519 for Digital Signatures**: This is the standard choice for modern applications requiring high-performance signatures. Small key/signature sizes and good security properties make it ideal for this use case.

4. **X25519 for Key Exchange**: Excellent compatibility with Ed25519 and well-established security properties. Using Curve25519 for both signing and key exchange is efficient.

5. **HKDF-SHA256 for Key Derivation**: This is a solid choice for deriving multiple keys from a master secret. It's standardized and well-understood.

## Considerations and Potential Improvements:

1. **Post-Quantum Readiness**: The specification correctly acknowledges the lack of post-quantum algorithms but suggests revisiting this in the future. I agree with this approach—starting with proven, mature algorithms and planning for a hybrid approach later is prudent.

2. **Nonce Management**: The specification mentions the need for unique nonces with ChaCha20-Poly1305 but could be more specific about nonce generation strategies. Consider adding:
   - Explicit counter-based nonce schemes
   - Recommendations for nonce length (96 bits is standard)
   - Clear strategies for preventing nonce reuse

3. **Key Sizes and Standards**: The specification is clear about key sizes, which is good. Consider explicitly mentioning:
   - RFC/standard compliance for each algorithm
   - Endianness considerations for interoperability
   - Serialization formats (e.g., using standard encoding like DER for signatures)

4. **Backup Hash Algorithm**: While BLAKE3 is excellent, consider specifying a backup algorithm explicitly (e.g., SHA3-256) for scenarios where BLAKE3 might not be available or for cross-system compatibility.

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Consider specifying a MAC algorithm (HMAC-SHA256) for scenarios where AEAD might not be applicable
   - Explicitly mention secure random number generation requirements
   - Consider specifying a password hashing function (Argon2id) for user credential protection

Overall, this specification demonstrates a good understanding of current cryptographic best practices and makes appropriate choices given the system's requirements. The focus on performance, security, and availability of Rust implementations is well-balanced.


# Key Management Protocol Specification

**Status:** Initial Design (Subject to refinement during implementation and security review)

This document outlines the protocols and strategies for managing cryptographic keys within the Decentralized Content Distribution System. It complements `docs/cryptography.md` by specifying *how* the selected primitives are used for key generation, derivation, storage interface, and the "Transactable Key" token mechanism.

## 1. Master Key / Seed

*   **Concept:** Each user identity within the system is associated with a single high-entropy master secret, typically represented as a BIP-39 mnemonic phrase (e.g., 12 or 24 words).
*   **Generation:** Generated securely using a CSPRNG (see `docs/cryptography.md`, Section 6) during user onboarding. The mnemonic phrase is presented to the user for backup.
*   **Storage:**
    *   The raw mnemonic phrase itself SHOULD NOT be stored directly by the application after initial generation/import, unless explicitly requested and secured by strong user-provided encryption (e.g., password-based KDF like Argon2id).
    *   The derived master *seed* (binary entropy derived from the mnemonic) is the operational root secret.
    *   The master seed requires extremely secure storage. The `storage-layer` module will provide an interface for this, ideally leveraging platform-specific secure enclaves (e.g., Keychain on macOS, TPM on Windows/Linux) or OS credential managers where possible. If unavailable, file-based storage MUST use strong encryption tied to a user-provided password/passphrase (using Argon2id + AEAD).
*   **Backup/Recovery:** Relies entirely on the user securely backing up their mnemonic phrase. The application should strongly emphasize this during onboarding. Recovery involves re-importing the mnemonic phrase.

## 2. Key Derivation Hierarchy

*   **Standard:** Follows a BIP-32/BIP-44 like hierarchical deterministic (HD) structure where feasible, but simplified for the specific needs of this application.
*   **KDF:** Uses HKDF-SHA256 as specified in `docs/cryptography.md`.
*   **Derivation Path:**
    1.  `Master Seed -> HKDF(salt="master", info="root-identity") -> Root Identity Key (RIK)`
        *   The RIK is the primary long-term secret derived directly from the seed.
    2.  `RIK -> HKDF(salt="identity-signing", info=purpose_string) -> Identity Signing Key Pair (Ed25519)`
        *   Used for signing transactions, high-level attestations. `purpose_string` could differentiate keys for different blockchains if needed.
    3.  `RIK -> HKDF(salt="content-key-derivation", info=content_id) -> Content Master Key (CMK)`
        *   A specific master key derived for a particular piece of content. `content_id` is a unique identifier for the content.
    4.  `CMK -> HKDF(salt="symmetric-encryption", info="slice-encryption") -> Symmetric Content Key (SCK - ChaCha20 Key)`
        *   The actual key used to encrypt the content slices.
    5.  `CMK -> HKDF(salt="token-signing", info="transactable-key-token") -> Token Signing Key Pair (Ed25519)`
        *   The specific key pair used by the *creator* to sign the "Transactable Key" tokens for *this specific content*.

*   **Rationale:**
    *   Using HKDF with distinct `salt` and `info` parameters ensures cryptographic separation between keys used for different purposes, minimizing the impact of a potential key compromise.
    *   Deriving content-specific keys allows for potential future revocation or different handling per content item.
    *   This avoids exposing the Root Identity Key directly for frequent operations like token signing.

## 3. "Transactable Key" Token Protocol

*   **Purpose:** To grant temporary, verifiable access rights to encrypted content slices, linking access to payment/ownership status without revealing the underlying Symmetric Content Key (SCK) directly until necessary or embedding it unsafely.
*   **Concept:** A digitally signed data structure (the token) created by the content *creator*. This token is provided to the *consumer* after successful payment/authorization. The consumer presents this token to *seeders* to prove their right to download specific slices. The token itself does *not* directly contain the SCK. It acts as a capability credential.
*   **Token Structure (Conceptual):**
    ```
    {
      "version": 1,
      "content_id": "unique_content_identifier", // Identifies the content
      "consumer_id": "optional_consumer_identifier", // Optional: Bind token to specific consumer?
      "permissions": ["read_slices"], // Defines allowed actions
      "valid_from": timestamp,      // Start time for validity
      "valid_until": timestamp,     // Expiry time for validity
      "issuance_timestamp": timestamp, // Time the token was created
      "creator_pubkey": "creator_signing_public_key_bytes" // Public key of the creator (for verification)
      // Other metadata as needed (e.g., rate limits?)
    }
    ```
*   **Token Generation (Creator):**
    1.  Gather the necessary metadata (content ID, validity times, etc.).
    2.  Canonicalize the metadata structure into a reproducible byte string (e.g., using JSON Canonicalization Scheme - RFC 8785, or a simpler fixed-format serialization).
    3.  Sign the canonical byte string using the content-specific `Token Signing Key Pair` (derived via HKDF as per section 2).
    4.  Format the final token: e.g., `base64url(canonical_metadata_bytes) + "." + base64url(signature_bytes)`. (Similar to JWT structure but simpler).
*   **Token Validation (Seeder / Verifier):**
    1.  Receive the token string from the consumer.
    2.  Parse the token string (e.g., split metadata and signature parts, decode base64url).
    3.  Deserialize/parse the metadata bytes.
    4.  Extract the `creator_pubkey` from the metadata. *(Initially, this pubkey might need to be fetched separately based on `content_id`, e.g., from the blockchain meta-hash entry, to prevent spoofing within the token itself)*.
    5.  Verify the signature against the metadata bytes using the *trusted* creator's public key associated with the `content_id`.
    6.  Check `valid_from` / `valid_until` against the current time.
    7.  Check `permissions` against the requested action (e.g., downloading a slice).
    8.  (Optional) Check `consumer_id` if present and relevant.
    9.  If all checks pass, the token is valid, and the seeder can proceed with the action (e.g., serving the requested slice).
*   **Key Revelation:** The token *validates the right to access*. The actual SCK (Symmetric Content Key) needed to decrypt the slices must be obtained separately by the authorized consumer, likely directly from the creator or via a mechanism tied to the payment/authorization step (e.g., encrypted with the consumer's public key after payment). This token protocol is primarily for *seeders* to verify download requests *without* needing access to the SCK.

## 4. Key Storage Interface (`storage-layer`)

*   The `storage-layer` module must provide an abstract interface for securely storing and retrieving sensitive key material (specifically the master seed or potentially derived long-term keys like RIK).
*   Implementations should prioritize hardware-backed stores (Secure Enclave, TPM, Keychain) or OS credential managers.
*   Fallback implementations MUST use strong password-based encryption (Argon2id + AEAD) requiring user interaction.
*   Short-term keys (like derived session keys or SCK during download) might be held securely in memory but should not be persisted unencrypted.

## 5. Security Considerations

*   **Mnemonic Backup:** User education on secure mnemonic backup is paramount.
*   **Secure Storage:** Protecting the master seed is critical. Compromise leads to full identity/fund loss.
*   **Key Derivation Context:** Using unique `salt` and `info` parameters in HKDF is crucial for domain separation.
*   **Token Security:**
    *   The creator's public key used for validation MUST be obtained securely (e.g., from the blockchain record), not solely trusted from within the token itself initially.
    *   Short token validity periods limit the window for misuse if a token is compromised.
    *   Replay attacks need consideration (e.g., nonces within requests, or linking tokens tightly to sessions).
*   **Implementation:** Use constant-time cryptographic operations where possible to avoid timing side channels. Rely on well-audited cryptographic libraries.

# OpenAI Response
This is a very strong initial draft.  
Overall, it's well-structured, clearly explained, and shows good cryptographic hygiene.  
I'll walk through my comments carefully, highlighting both **strengths** and **potential areas for refinement**:

---

## General Strengths:
- **Clear Domain Separation:**  
  Your use of HKDF with unique `salt` and `info` per derivation purpose is exactly right. Very clean separation.

- **Threat Modeling Awareness:**  
  You've preemptively thought about compromise impacts, token replay, secure storage fallback, and the risks of trusting embedded pubkeys. That's rare for a first draft — excellent.

- **Good User Experience Awareness:**  
  Emphasis on mnemonic backup and fallback secure storage (with password+Argon2id+AEAD) shows you are thinking about real-world user behavior and risk.

- **Sensible Minimalism:**  
  Instead of inventing something overly fancy, your "Transactable Key" protocol is similar to JWT in structure but simpler and more fit-for-purpose. Good instincts.

---

## Suggested Improvements & Clarifications:

### 1. **Master Seed Handling**
- You currently propose *maybe* storing the encrypted mnemonic if the user explicitly requests it.  
  🔹 **Suggestion:** Consider defaulting to *never* storing the mnemonic, even encrypted — only the derived seed (secured properly). Mnemonics have poor ergonomics for secure storage once "in system."  
  🔹 Alternative: if user wants convenience, recommend they use a separate external password manager (Bitwarden, etc.) for mnemonic storage rather than embedding it inside your system.

---

### 2. **Derivation Path Documentation**
- Right now the derivation hierarchy is great, but very *verbally* described.  
  🔹 **Suggestion:** It would help implementation later if you formalize a compact "path notation."  
  Example:
  ```
  m / master -> RIK
  RIK / purpose:identity-signing -> Identity Signing Key
  RIK / purpose:content-key-derivation / content_id -> CMK
  CMK / purpose:symmetric-encryption -> SCK
  CMK / purpose:token-signing -> Token Signing Key
  ```
  Not BIP-44 exactly, but a simple internal notation will *greatly* reduce bugs across teams.

---

### 3. **Token Replay Attack Mitigation**
- You mention this briefly ("nonces within requests, or linking tokens to sessions").  
  🔹 **Suggestion:** Strengthen this section a little: 
    - Recommend that seeders enforce short-term *session nonces* when receiving tokens.
    - Or that token validation includes optional binding to download session IDs or IP/peer IDs.

  Without this, a stolen token could be replayed against many seeders if they're naive.

---

### 4. **Key Revelation Timing**
- You say "the actual Symmetric Content Key must be obtained separately after authorization."  
  🔹 **Suggestion:** Outline (even briefly) the options for this in the spec:
    - e.g., Creator encrypts the SCK to the Consumer's public key after successful payment?
    - Secure pull (HTTPS? Blockchain oracle? Peer-to-peer messaging?)
    - Should the consumer be able to **prove** receipt to the seeders later? (Probably not, but spell it out.)

This will help prevent divergent implementations and clarify threat surfaces.

---

### 5. **Secure Public Key Fetch**
- You correctly flag that the creator pubkey must be verified *externally* (e.g., blockchain).  
  🔹 **Suggestion:** Be explicit:  
    - If the pubkey-to-content_id binding is immutable (e.g., blockchain hash anchored), that must be a hard requirement.  
    - Do not allow seeders to lazily fetch pubkeys from creators' own infrastructure unless separately verified — that would allow impersonation.

---

### 6. **Terminology**
- The phrase "**Transactable Key Token**" is fine but slightly heavy.  
  🔹 You might consider renaming slightly, something like:  
    - **Access Token**  
    - **Slice Capability Token**  
    - **Proof of Access Token (PAT)**  

  Not critical, but if your system uses *more than one* kind of token later (e.g., revocation tokens, refund tokens), you'll appreciate tighter namespacing early.

---

## Minor / Style Notes:
- ✅ Love that you considered canonicalization (RFC 8785).  
- ✅ Like that you called for constant-time crypto ops.
- ✅ Like that you recommend *platform-backed secure enclaves* first, falling back only when necessary.
- ⚡ It might be worth adding a "future considerations" note about post-quantum readiness (even if deferred).

---

## Final Score:
- **Technical correctness:** ★★★★★  
- **Security hygiene:** ★★★★★  
- **Implementation clarity:** ★★★★☆ (formal derivation path would make it even easier)  
- **Operational UX awareness:** ★★★★☆ (backup/storage flow solid, token expiration UX could be a little clearer)

---

Would you like me to mock up an even tighter, slightly more formal version of this spec based on your work (with diagrams of derivation paths, token lifecycle, etc.)?  
It might be useful if you're planning to hand this off to devs or auditors. 🚀

# Claude Response
After reviewing the Key Management Protocol Specification, I find it to be a well-designed and thoughtful approach that addresses many critical aspects of secure key management. Here's my detailed analysis:

## Strengths of the Specification:

1. **Master Key/Seed with BIP-39**: Using a BIP-39 mnemonic is a proven, user-friendly approach for backup and recovery. The emphasis on never storing the raw mnemonic directly is correct.

2. **Hierarchical Key Derivation**: The BIP-32/BIP-44-like structure provides excellent separation of concerns between different key purposes. The use of HKDF with distinct salt and info parameters is a security best practice that prevents cross-domain key misuse.

3. **Transactable Key Token Protocol**: The separation between access validation (via tokens) and actual content decryption (via SCK) is a sophisticated design choice that:
   - Minimizes exposure of the content encryption key
   - Allows for time-bounded access control
   - Enables seeders to validate requests without needing decryption keys

4. **Security-First Design**: The focus on secure storage options (hardware enclaves, TPMs) with strong fallbacks shows good security awareness.

## Areas for Consideration or Enhancement:

1. **Key Rotation Mechanisms**: While the hierarchical derivation is excellent, the specification could be more explicit about:
   - How key rotation would work for compromised keys
   - Forward secrecy considerations for long-lived content
   - Recovery procedures for partially compromised keys

2. **Consumer Public Key Infrastructure**: The specification focuses heavily on creator keys but less on consumer identity. Consider:
   - How consumers establish and manage their identity keys
   - How creators obtain trusted consumer public keys for SCK encryption
   - Consumer key recovery scenarios

3. **Token Lifecycle Management**:
   - Consider adding token revocation lists or mechanisms
   - Address how to handle bulk token generation for many consumers
   - Consider rate limiting or quota mechanisms within tokens
   - Explicitly define token invalidation upon key compromise

4. **Implementation Security Considerations**:
   - Specify requirements for secure memory handling (e.g., zeroing sensitive data)
   - Consider adding specific requirements for thread safety in key operations
   - Address concurrent access patterns for key storage interfaces

5. **Operational Considerations**:
   - Define clear procedures for key backup/recovery beyond just the mnemonic
   - Consider operational key rotation policies
   - Specify monitoring and audit logging requirements for key operations

6. **Additional Protocol Elements**:
   - Define error handling for key operations (e.g., what happens if derivation fails)
   - Consider adding key usage counters or restrictions
   - Specify key export formats for interoperability

7. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Consider caching strategies for frequently used derived keys
   - Address potential bottlenecks in key derivation for high-throughput scenarios

8. **Compliance and Standards**:
   - Reference specific standards where applicable (NIST, FIPS)
   - Consider compliance with key management standards like KMIP if relevant

## Implementation Recommendations:

1. **Secure Coding Practices**: Implement constant-time operations, secure memory wiping, and use well-audited libraries like `orion`, `ring`, or `RustCrypto`.

2. **Testing Strategy**: Include comprehensive test vectors for all key derivation paths and explicit tests for edge cases in the token protocol.

3. **Audit Trail**: Implement detailed logging for all key operations (creation, derivation, usage) with appropriate security controls.

4. **Documentation**: Create detailed operational procedures for key management tasks including backup, recovery, and rotation.

Overall, this specification demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of secure key management principles and provides a solid foundation for implementation. The hierarchical structure, proper use of modern cryptographic primitives, and separation between access control and content encryption are all excellent design choices.
