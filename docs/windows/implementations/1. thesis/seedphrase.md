We're going to generate a product requirements document for a cryptologic software implementation. 

Consider bittorrent. A file transformed into a hash. Seeders hold the hash and some portion of the file content. Leechers download the hash, then use it to collect the slices of the file from the seeders. Modern versions support encrypted streaming. 

Consider streaming. The need to order downloads of the hash so that the slices are preferentially delivered in order, as close to real time as possible. 

Consider encryption. A creator encrypting a file and creating a master key. The master key can produce infinite, unique, transactable keys to decrypt the file. The creator of the file creates and uniquely transacts the keys to decrypt the file. 

Consider crypto. The ability of a leecher to pay dynamically, and a seeder and creator to get paid dynamically, in microtransactions to supply the file slices. 

Consider traditional .torrent hashes. Consider a new concept of a meta hash component that has contains a preview of the file, other metadata, and the method to download the full file. The component that carries the hash and preview is structured as an internet comment with reactions, follows, and views saved in its metadata. It's posted to a generic api feed. 

A new decentralized torrent hosting method, encrypted with transactable, creator-controlled keys, seeders and creators get paid microtransactions, and the hash is a social media interaction card with reactions, links, and other social engagement. 

These hash files for encrypted transactable stores are hosted on an immutable but contributive blockchain. Anyone can download the hash, you can download the stores and seed them but not decrypt them (seed but no key), you can buy a key to decrypt them.

Anyone can download the encrypted blockchain, and your the decryption keys dictate what you can decrypt from the node you're seeding. Users create new content of any sort, encrypt it, sell the keys, distribute it over blockchain hash hosting and torrent. 

A combination of bittorrent and blockchain for a creator-centric microtransaction enabled distributed internet feed. 

Let's discuss this idea and explore the requirements to implement it in a Tauri/Rust application in a step-by-step implementation. 

Explain how you would go about creating a plan to implement this in a sophisticated, professional, scalable, distributed way. Make a checklist of a software development plan representing an ideal working implementation of this description.
