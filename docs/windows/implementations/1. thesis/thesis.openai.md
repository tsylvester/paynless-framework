This concept is a compelling intersection of **Bittorrent**, **blockchain**, **cryptographic access control**, **microtransaction-based monetization**, and **decentralized social content discovery**. It's essentially a **creator-first cryptographic content delivery network (CDN)** with payment rails and social integration, intended to run in a **Tauri/Rust** application for speed, security, and portability.

Below is a **high-level product development plan** broken down into **discrete stages**, representing a comprehensive, professional, and scalable approach.

---

## ✅ Product Development Plan: Encrypted, Transactable, Distributed CDN with Social Feed

---

### 1. **Requirements Analysis & Planning**
- [ ] Define key use cases (content creation, encryption, key distribution, seeding, streaming, payment).
- [ ] Determine actors: Creator, Seeder, Leecher (Viewer/Consumer), Blockchain Node, Smart Contract.
- [ ] Define architecture components: Torrenting system, blockchain store, encryption system, microtransaction system, social feed layer, UI/UX for Tauri app.
- [ ] Select blockchain platform (e.g. Arweave, IPFS/Filecoin, or custom PoS/PoW chain).
- [ ] Select crypto transaction layer (e.g. Lightning Network, ERC-4337, custom zk-based layer).
- [ ] Document tech stack (Tauri + Rust backend, WASM, P2P lib like libp2p or WebTorrent for Rust, cryptographic libs, etc).

---

### 2. **Architecture Design**
- [ ] Design **multi-layer architecture**:
  - **Content Layer**: File chunking, encryption, hash generation, seeding
  - **Torrent Layer**: P2P slice delivery, ordering engine for streaming
  - **Blockchain Layer**: Immutable hash + preview + metadata store, access-controlled via smart contracts
  - **Payment Layer**: Streaming microtransactions (pay-per-slice or timed access)
  - **Key Management**: Transactable master key → derived decryption keys
  - **Social Layer**: API feed, comment cards, metadata tracking (reactions/views)
- [ ] Define APIs between components.
- [ ] Create data model: hash format, metadata schema, encryption parameters, preview generation, key token format.

---

### 3. **Core Cryptographic Infrastructure**
- [ ] Implement content encryption:
  - AES-CTR or ChaCha20 per slice
  - Master key → derived per-user/per-session keys
- [ ] Key issuance protocol:
  - Nonce-based or indexed deterministic derivation
  - Ledgered as smart contract transactions
- [ ] Encrypted slice manifest (similar to `.torrent`) including access requirements.

---

### 4. **Distributed File System**
- [ ] Implement torrent seeding in Rust (libtorrent-rs, or custom with libp2p).
- [ ] Build ordering engine to prioritize slice delivery for streaming.
- [ ] Create encrypted `.torrent` manifest that hides actual content.
- [ ] Allow seeding without key (can upload and serve encrypted slices).

---

### 5. **Blockchain Hash Store**
- [ ] Design smart contract schema for:
  - Content registration
  - Key purchase
  - Payment tracking
- [ ] Design immutable feed system (like Twitter but stored on-chain or via content-addressed systems).
- [ ] Include preview image/audio/video clip + comment metadata + download method in the meta hash object.

---

### 6. **Payment & Microtransactions**
- [ ] Integrate crypto payment system:
  - Streaming microtransactions per slice or time-unit
  - Use of pre-funded wallet for smooth UX
- [ ] Payments split between seeder and creator
- [ ] Smart contract to validate decryption key access after payment

---

### 7. **Social Discovery Layer**
- [ ] Create feed format (API + chain storage) for social interaction
- [ ] Allow reactions (likes, comments, reposts) tied to meta hash objects
- [ ] Display views and engagement metrics stored off-chain (optionally mirrored on-chain)

---

### 8. **Tauri/Rust Application**
- [ ] Develop secure local vault for storing downloaded encrypted files & keys
- [ ] Build Tauri frontend:
  - Content feed (social)
  - Viewer for previews
  - Streamer/player for decrypted content
  - Wallet & payment interface
  - File uploader for creators
- [ ] Implement user authentication (wallet address, optional profiles)

---

### 9. **Networking & Syncing**
- [ ] Ensure all nodes can:
  - Download new hash cards (social feed)
  - Seed encrypted files for others
  - Sync with blockchain data
- [ ] Enable low-latency slice negotiation between seeders and leechers
- [ ] P2P incentivization for seeding encrypted data

---

### 10. **Security, Privacy & Trust**
- [ ] End-to-end encryption: seeders can never access decrypted content
- [ ] Ensure forward secrecy of decryption keys
- [ ] Implement audit logs of key transactions & purchases
- [ ] Sanity checks and fraud protection (e.g., fake slice injection prevention)

---

### 11. **Deployment & DevOps**
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline for Tauri (cross-platform builds)
- [ ] Decentralized bootstrap nodes and fallback indexes
- [ ] Key recovery system for creators
- [ ] Privacy-conscious telemetry and error reporting

---

### 12. **Testing & Launch**
- [ ] Unit, integration, fuzz, and stress testing for crypto and torrent systems
- [ ] Simulate large-scale streaming and payment behavior
- [ ] Beta network with real content & creators
- [ ] Launch mainnet with smart contract & decentralized store

---

### 13. **Post-Launch Expansion**
- [ ] Add features like subscriptions, bundling content, auctioned access
- [ ] Community governance for featured hash cards
- [ ] SDK for third-party apps to interface with the system
- [ ] Interop with existing torrent clients (via plugin or wrapper)
