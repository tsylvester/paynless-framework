I'll help you develop a plan for implementing this decentralized, encrypted content distribution system. Let's break down the concept and then create a comprehensive checklist for implementation.

## Understanding the Concept

You're describing a sophisticated fusion of several technologies:
- BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer file sharing
- Blockchain for immutable storage and transaction records
- Cryptographic access control with creator-managed keys
- Social media features built into content distribution
- Microtransaction payment system for content creators and seeders

This system would allow creators to distribute encrypted content, maintain control through key management, earn revenue through microtransactions, and build social engagement around their content.

## Technical Implementation Considerations

For the Tauri/Rust implementation, I would recommend:

1. **Core Network Layer**: Implement using Rust with libraries like `libp2p` for the peer-to-peer networking foundation.

2. **Blockchain Integration**: Consider integrating with an existing blockchain with smart contract capabilities, or implement a custom light client in Rust.

3. **Cryptography**: Use established Rust cryptography libraries like `RustCrypto` for implementing the encryption/decryption and key management.

4. **UI Layer**: Build the frontend using a framework that works well with Tauri, such as React, Vue, or Svelte.

5. **Database**: Use a local embedded database like `sled` or `RocksDB` for storing local data.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Implement asynchronous processing using Rust's async/await capabilities to handle multiple connections efficiently.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this implementation plan?
