Everyone has made excellent points. This is an incredible concept with enormous potential but it must be planned, architected, designed, and implemented meticulously. It must be correct the first time. 

We have much excellent content to reflect on. We are going to synthesize all of the points made, improving, resolving, addressing, and correcting every aspect of this plan that we can. 

We are going to produce an extraordinarily detailed, dense, and thorough explanation of how to synthesize all of the points raised in the simplest, most reliable, maintainable, inexpensive, distributed, robust, secure methods we can. 

The end product of our work will be an extensive checklist that details the full implementation, testing, and deployment path required for this feature. 

The implementation will be atomic and test-driven, proving that it works at each granular step of the weay. We will build in rust stepwise so that we can prove from testing that each step works as we go. 

We should probably begin with the encryption method for the proposed blockchain-bittorrent integration that produces transactable keys.
