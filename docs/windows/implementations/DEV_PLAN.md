# Development Plan: Decentralized Content Distribution System (Synthesized)

This document outlines the **phased development approach** for the decentralized content distribution system, based on the detailed plan established in `docs/implementations/3. synthesis/synthesis.gemini.md`. It supersedes previous versions of the development plan.

This plan prioritizes **risk reduction through early validation** of core technological assumptions via Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) before committing to full-scale implementation.

## Guiding Principles

Development will adhere strictly to the following principles, derived from the synthesis phase:

*   **Risk-First, PoC-Driven Validation:** Tackle the hardest, highest-risk problems *first*. Build small, focused PoCs to validate core assumptions about technology choices (blockchain, payments, streaming) before scaling development. *Fail fast* on unworkable approaches.
*   **Explicit Design & Decision Making:** Document *all* design decisions, architectural choices, and protocol specifications with clear rationale and trade-offs. Avoid ambiguity. Maintain living documentation (`STRUCTURE.md`, `DEV_PLAN.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `TESTING_PLAN.md`).
*   **Security as Foundation:** Integrate security thinking from day one. Perform thorough threat modeling, use secure coding practices, plan for audits, and select robust cryptographic primitives. Assume adversarial conditions.
*   **Economic Soundness:** Design, simulate, and test the economic incentive model rigorously. Ensure it genuinely encourages desired behavior (seeding, content creation) and resists manipulation.
*   **Iterative Development & Testing:** Employ Test-Driven Development (TDD) / Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), continuous integration (CI), comprehensive testing (unit, integration, end-to-end, network simulation, security penetration), and phased rollouts.
*   **User-Centricity within Constraints:** While decentralization imposes constraints, strive for the best possible user experience, especially around complex aspects like key management and payments.
*   **Modularity & Maintainability:** Build well-defined, loosely coupled components (Rust crates/modules) with clear APIs (Rust traits) to manage complexity and facilitate future development.

## Development Phases

The project is broken down into five core phases:

### Phase 0: Foundation, Validation & Architecture Definition (Milestone: Validated Core Tech & Architecture)

## Dependencies

This plan establishes a clearer flow:
- Phase 1 depends heavily on the validated designs, PoCs, and decisions from Phase 0.
- Phase 2 builds upon the integrated core modules from Phase 1, adding economic and social dimensions.
- Phase 3 provides the user interface and client-side logic integrating features from Phases 0, 1, and 2.
- Phase 4 focuses on testing, hardening, and operationalizing the system developed in Phases 0-3.

Each phase includes specific testing activities relevant to its scope, culminating in the comprehensive testing and auditing in Phase 4. Planning documents are expected to be living documents, updated as decisions are made and designs evolve throughout these phases.
