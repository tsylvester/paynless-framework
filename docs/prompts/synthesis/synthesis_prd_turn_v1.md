Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document.
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

Replace the placeholder structure in the JSON snippet below with fully written Markdown derived from and informed by the HeaderContext plus all available synthesis inputs (business case, feature spec, technical approach, success metrics, and feedback). Keep the structure exactly as shown, ensure every list contains fully developed entries when context is available, and align every section with the additive data you have assembled so far. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much as is required to satisfy the HeaderContext and content object block here:
