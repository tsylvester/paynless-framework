You are a {{role}}, act accordingly. Your response will follow this style guide: {{style_guide_markdown}}
Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document.
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

In this turn you are writing a product requirements document that describes how to meet the user's objective. 

Replace the placeholder value for each key of the JSON object below with fully written Markdown content derived from and informed by the HeaderContext. Each field should contain the markdown content for that section (paragraphs, bullet lists, etc.). For array fields, populate with strings representing list items. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much content as required to satisfy the HeaderContext:

{"content":{"mvp_description":"Describe the minimum viable product scope and key capabilities, derived from consolidated synthesis documents in the HeaderContext.","user_problem_validation":"Summarize evidence that the problem is real and pressing, referencing consolidated business case and feature spec synthesis from the HeaderContext.","market_opportunity":"Describe the target audience, market sizing, and opportunity, derived from consolidated business case synthesis in the HeaderContext.","competitive_analysis":"Compare the proposal against relevant alternatives, incorporating consolidated competitive analysis from the HeaderContext.","differentiation_&_value_proposition":"Highlight the unique advantages of the proposed approach, derived from consolidated business case synthesis in the HeaderContext.","risks_&_mitigation":"List the primary risks and mitigation strategies, incorporating consolidated risk analysis from business case and technical approach synthesis in the HeaderContext.","strengths":[],"weaknesses":[],"opportunities":[],"threats":[],"feature_scope":[],"features":[{"feature_name":"Name the feature, derived from consolidated feature spec synthesis in the HeaderContext.","feature_objective":"State the feature's purpose and goals, incorporating consolidated feature objectives from the HeaderContext.","user_stories":[],"acceptance_criteria":[],"dependencies":[],"success_metrics":[],"risk_mitigation":"Describe risk mitigation strategies for this feature, derived from consolidated feature spec and technical approach synthesis in the HeaderContext.","open_questions":"List open questions for this feature, incorporating consolidated questions from feature spec synthesis in the HeaderContext.","tradeoffs":[]}],"feasibility_insights":[],"non_functional_alignment":[],"score_adjustments":[],"outcome_alignment":"Explain how outcomes align with success metrics, derived from consolidated success metrics synthesis in the HeaderContext.","north_star_metric":"Define the primary north star metric, derived from consolidated success metrics synthesis in the HeaderContext.","primary_kpis":[],"leading_indicators":[],"lagging_indicators":[],"guardrails":[],"measurement_plan":"Describe the measurement plan, derived from consolidated success metrics synthesis in the HeaderContext.","risk_signals":[],"resolved_positions":[],"open_questions":[],"next_steps":"Outline immediate actions, decisions, or follow-ups required, aligned with all consolidated synthesis documents in the HeaderContext.","proposal_references":[],"release_plan":[],"assumptions":[],"open_decisions":[],"implementation_risks":[],"stakeholder_communications":[],"executive_summary":"Provide a concise synopsis of the product requirements, highlighting purpose, scope, and key insights from all consolidated synthesis documents in the HeaderContext."}}

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
