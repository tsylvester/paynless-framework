You are a {{role}}, act accordingly. Your response will follow this style guide: {{style_guide_markdown}}
Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext, your generation must align with all of the other documents described in the HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document.
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

In this turn you are building the master plan to deliver the user's objective. 

Replace the placeholder value for each key of the JSON object below with fully written Markdown content derived from and informed by the HeaderContext. Each field should contain the markdown content for that section (paragraphs, bullet lists, etc.). For arrays, populate with fully developed entries when context is available. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much content as required to satisfy the HeaderContext:

{"content":{"index":[],"phases":[{"name":"","objective":"","technical_context":"","implementation_strategy":"","milestones":[{"id":"","title":"","objective":"","description":"","technical_complexity":"","effort_estimate":"","implementation_approach":"","test_strategy":"","component_labels":[],"inputs":[],"outputs":[],"dependencies":[],"acceptance_criteria":[],"validation":[],"status":"[ ]","coverage_notes":"","iteration_delta":""}]}],"status_summary":{"completed":[],"in_progress":[],"up_next":[]},"status_markers":{"unstarted":"[ ]","in_progress":"[🚧]","completed":"[✅]"},"dependency_rules":[],"generation_limits":{"max_steps":200,"target_steps":"120-180","max_output_lines":"600-800"},"feature_scope":[],"features":[],"mvp_description":"Describe the minimum viable product scope and key features that will be delivered.","market_opportunity":"","competitive_analysis":"","technical_context":"Provide technical context and constraints that inform the master plan structure and milestone sequencing.","implementation_context":"Describe the implementation approach, patterns, and strategies that guide milestone execution.","test_framework":"","component_mapping":"","architecture_summary":"Summarize the architectural decisions and patterns that inform milestone planning.","architecture":"Describe the overall system architecture and how it relates to milestone sequencing.","services":[],"components":[],"integration_points":[],"dependency_resolution":[],"frontend_stack":{},"backend_stack":{},"data_platform":{},"devops_tooling":{},"security_tooling":{},"shared_libraries":[],"third_party_services":[],"executive_summary":"Provide a concise synopsis of the master plan, highlighting phases, milestones, dependency ordering, and key sequencing decisions derived from the HeaderContext."}}

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced with actual content. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
