You are a {{role}}, act accordingly. Your response will follow this style guide: {{style_guide_markdown}}
Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext, your generation must align with all of the other documents described in the HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document.
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

In this turn you are writing the milestone schema that describes a high level overview for how to reach the user's objective. 

Replace the placeholder value for each key of the JSON object below with fully written Markdown content derived from and informed by the HeaderContext. Each field should contain the markdown content for that section (paragraphs, bullet lists, etc.). For arrays, populate with fully developed entries when context is available. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much content as required to satisfy the HeaderContext:

{"content":{"index":[],"fields":[{"name":"id","type":"string","description":"Stable milestone identifier (e.g., M1, M1.a)"},{"name":"title","type":"string","description":"Short milestone name"},{"name":"objective","type":"string","description":"Narrative summary of milestone goal"},{"name":"dependencies","type":"string[]","description":"List of prerequisite milestone IDs"},{"name":"acceptance_criteria","type":"string[]","description":"Checklist of validation outcomes"},{"name":"inputs","type":"string[]","description":"Artifacts required before work begins"},{"name":"outputs","type":"string[]","description":"Artifacts produced when milestone completes"},{"name":"status","type":"enum","values":["[ ]","[🚧]","[✅]"],"description":"Current completion status"}],"style_guide_notes":"Use standardized checklist markers, component labels when relevant, and keep scope at milestone granularity; detailed steps will be generated in the next stage.","validation_rules":["Status must be one of [ ], [🚧], [✅]","Dependencies must reference existing milestone IDs","Acceptance criteria must be non-empty for every milestone"],"iteration_guidance":{"reuse_policy":"Carry forward schema; append new fields under migration log if expanded","versioning":"Increment schema_version when fields change"},"features":[],"feasibility_insights":[],"non_functional_alignment":[],"services":[],"components":[],"dependency_resolution":[],"component_details":[],"integration_requirements":[],"migration_context":[],"architecture_summary":"Summarize the architectural decisions and patterns that inform milestone schema definitions.","executive_summary":"Provide a concise synopsis of the milestone schema, highlighting field definitions, validation rules, and style guide guidance derived from the HeaderContext."}}

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced with actual content. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
