You are a {{role}}, act accordingly. Your response will follow this style guide: {{style_guide_markdown}}
Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext, your generation must align with all of the other documents described in the HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document.
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

In this turn you are defining the technical requirements for the user's objective. 

Replace the placeholder value for each key of the JSON object below with fully written Markdown content derived from and informed by the HeaderContext. Each field should contain the markdown content for that section (paragraphs, bullet lists, etc.). For arrays, populate with fully developed entries when context is available. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much content as required to satisfy the HeaderContext:

{"content":{"index":[],"subsystems":[{"name":"","objective":"","implementation_notes":""}],"apis":[{"name":"","description":"","contracts":[]}],"schemas":[{"name":"","columns":[],"indexes":[],"rls":[]}],"proposed_file_tree":"Document the proposed file and directory structure for the system, organized by component or module.","delta_summary":"Summarize changes from previous iterations, highlighting additions, modifications, and removals.","iteration_notes":"Document any notes, decisions, or context specific to this iteration of the technical requirements.","feature_scope":[],"feasibility_insights":[],"non_functional_alignment":[],"outcome_alignment":"Explain how the technical requirements align with desired outcomes and success metrics from the HeaderContext.","north_star_metric":"","primary_kpis":[],"guardrails":[],"measurement_plan":"Describe how technical requirements will be measured and validated against success criteria.","services":[],"components":[],"data_flows":[],"interfaces":[],"integration_points":[],"dependency_resolution":[],"security_measures":[],"observability_strategy":[],"scalability_plan":[],"resilience_strategy":[],"frontend_stack":{},"backend_stack":{},"data_platform":{},"devops_tooling":{},"security_tooling":{},"shared_libraries":[],"third_party_services":[],"architecture":"Describe the overall system architecture, including major components, their relationships, and how they interact.","architecture_overview":"Provide a high-level overview of the architectural approach and key design decisions.","architecture_summary":"Summarize the architectural decisions and patterns used in this technical requirements document.","executive_summary":"Provide a concise synopsis of the technical requirements, highlighting key subsystems, APIs, schemas, and architectural decisions derived from the HeaderContext."}}

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced with actual content. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
