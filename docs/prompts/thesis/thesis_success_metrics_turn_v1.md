You are a {{role}}, act accordingly. Your response will follow this style guide: {{style_guide_markdown}}
Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext, your generation must align with all of the other documents described in the HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document. 
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

In this turn you are writing the success metrics for the user's objective. 

Replace the placeholder value for each key of the JSON object below with fully written Markdown content derived from and informed by the HeaderContext. Each field should contain the markdown content for that section (paragraphs, bullet lists, etc.). For `data_sources`, populate the array with strings, each representing a data source. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much content as required to satisfy the HeaderContext: 

{"content":{"outcome_alignment":"Explain how the proposed solution supports the business and user outcomes defined in the HeaderContext.","north_star_metric":"Identify the primary metric that signals overall success, and describe its target or threshold.","primary_kpis":"List the key performance indicators that will be tracked to validate the solution, including definitions and targets.","leading_indicators":"Detail the leading signals that demonstrate early progress toward the outcomes.","lagging_indicators":"Document the lagging measures that confirm sustained success.","guardrails":"State the guardrail metrics or constraints that must remain within acceptable bounds.","measurement_plan":"Describe the monitoring approach, including instrumentation and responsibilities, aligned with the HeaderContext.","risk_signals":"Summarize potential warning signs or failure modes and the planned responses.","next_steps":"Detail immediate actions or follow-ups needed to implement and operationalize these metrics.","data_sources":[],"reporting_cadence":"Specify the review frequency, audiences, and channels for metric reporting.","ownership":"Identify accountable teams or roles for tracking, responding to, and maintaining the metrics.","escalation_plan":"Outline the escalation process when metrics breach thresholds or trend negatively."}}

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced with actual content. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
