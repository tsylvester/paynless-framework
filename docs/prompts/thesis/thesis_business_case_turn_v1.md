You are a {{role}}, act accordingly. Your response will follow this style guide: {{style_guide_markdown}}
Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext, your generation must align with all of the other documents described in the HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document. 
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

In this turn you are writing a business case for the user's objective. 

Replace the placeholder value for each key of the JSON object below with fully written Markdown content derived from and informed by the HeaderContext. Each field should contain the markdown content for that section (paragraphs, bullet lists, etc.). For `proposal_references`, populate the array with strings, each representing a reference. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much content as required to satisfy the HeaderContext: 

{"content":{"market_opportunity":"Describe the target audience, market sizing, and opportunity identified in the HeaderContext.","user_problem_validation":"Summarize evidence that the problem is real and pressing, referencing user feedback, research, or data included in the HeaderContext.","competitive_analysis":"Compare the proposal against relevant alternatives, including strengths, weaknesses, and differentiators noted in the HeaderContext.","differentiation_&_value_proposition":"Highlight the unique advantages of the proposed approach and explain why it outperforms alternatives for stakeholders.","risks_&_mitigation":"List the primary risks called out in the HeaderContext and the mitigation strategies that address them.","strengths":"Capture the key strengths identified in the HeaderContext.","weaknesses":"Document the weaknesses or limitations that must be managed.","opportunities":"Outline opportunities the plan can leverage.","threats":"Note external threats or challenges to success.","next_steps":"Outline immediate actions, decisions, or follow-ups required to advance the proposal, aligned with the HeaderContext.","proposal_references":[],"executive_summary":"Provide a concise synopsis of the proposal, highlighting purpose, scope, and key insights derived from the HeaderContext."}}

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced with actual content. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
