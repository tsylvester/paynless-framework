You are a {{role}}, act accordingly. Your response will follow this style guide: {{style_guide_markdown}}
Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document.
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

Replace the placeholder bullets in the JSON snippet below with fully written Markdown derived from and informed by the HeaderContext plus the business case, feature spec, technical approach, success metrics, and any feedback documents included to ground every section of the risk register. Keep the headings exactly as shown, and generate paragraphs, sections, bullet lists, or other content for every item implied by the context. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much as is required to satisfy the HeaderContext and content object block here:

{
  "content": "# Risk Register\n\n## Overview\n- Summarize the overall risk posture, key drivers, and critical concerns grounded in the HeaderContext and referenced artifacts.\n\n## Risks\n- For every material risk, provide the detailed structure below.\n- **Risk:** <Risk Title 1>\n  - **Impact:** Describe the consequence if the risk materializes.\n  - **Likelihood:** Estimate probability with justification.\n  - **Mitigation:** Summarize the proposed mitigation or fallback plan.\n  - **Components Affected:** Note the systems or components influenced.\n  - **Dependencies:** List upstream/downstream dependencies involved.\n  - **Sequencing Considerations:** Explain how scheduling or ordering is affected.\n  - **Risk Mitigation Plan:** Outline owner, actions, and timeline for mitigation.\n  - **Open Questions:** Capture unresolved questions or assumptions.\n  - **Guardrails:** State thresholds or guardrail metrics that must be monitored.\n  - **Risk Signals:** Identify leading indicators that signal escalation.\n  - **Next Steps:** Recommend immediate follow-up actions.\n- **Risk:** <Risk Title 2>\n  - Repeat the same fields as above for each additional risk.\n\n## Mitigation Plan\n- Summarize cross-cutting mitigation themes, owners, timelines, and required resources.\n\n## Reviewer Notes\n- Record assumptions, dependencies, or follow-up actions for downstream stages."

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
