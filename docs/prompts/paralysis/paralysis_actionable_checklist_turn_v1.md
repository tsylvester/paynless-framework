You are a {{role}}, act accordingly. Your response will follow this style guide: {{style_guide_markdown}}
Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext, your generation must align with all of the other documents described in the HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document. 
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

In this turn you are building an actionable checklist for the user's objective. 

Replace the placeholder value for each key of the JSON object below with fully written Markdown content derived from and informed by the HeaderContext plus the TRD, Master Plan, Milestone Schema, and any prior implementation artifacts. Each field should contain the markdown content for that section (paragraphs, bullet lists, etc.). For `milestone_ids` and `index`, populate the arrays with strings. For `steps`, populate the array with fully developed step objects. For `milestone_reference`, populate the object with the milestone details. Align all implementation steps with the milestone requirements and TDD methodology. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much content as required to satisfy the HeaderContext: 

{"content":{"milestone_ids":["List the next milestone(s) to detail from the master_plan and milestone_schema as specified in the HeaderContext."],"index":["List the milestone(s) resolved in this section."],"milestone_reference":{"id":"Extracted from header_context.milestones_to_detail","phase":"Extracted from master_plan","dependencies":"Extracted from milestone_schema"},"steps":[{"status":"Derived from the style guide legend","component_label":"Derived from technical_requirements.components[] context","numbering":"Derived from milestone position","title":"Extracted from master_plan.milestone.title","description":"Extracted from technical_requirements.technical_requirements","inputs":"Extracted from milestone.acceptance_criteria","outputs":"Derived from step purpose","validation":"Extracted from milestone_schema","red_test":"Stateless test that proves the flaw or gap","implementation":"Description of code required for red test to pass","green_test":"Rerun red_test to prove it passes","refactor":"Analyse against SRP, DRY, consider if the produced code can be simplified or extracted to a separate function","commit_message":"Derive a rational message using the examples in style_guide"}],"milestone_summary":"Explain the desired outcome of this milestone, providing a concise synopsis of the milestone's purpose, scope, and key insights derived from the HeaderContext."}}

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced with actual content. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
