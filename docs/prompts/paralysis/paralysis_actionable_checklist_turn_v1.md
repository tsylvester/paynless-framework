Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document.
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

Replace the placeholder structure in the JSON snippet below with fully written JSON derived from and informed by the HeaderContext plus the TRD, Master Plan, Milestone Schema, and any prior implementation artifacts. Keep the structure exactly as shown, ensure every array contains fully developed entries when context is available, and align all implementation steps with the milestone requirements and TDD methodology. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much as is required to satisfy the HeaderContext and content object block here:

{
  "content": "{\n  \"index\": [<list the milestone(s) resolved in this section>],\n  \"milestone_summary\": \"<explain the desired outcome of this milestone>\",\n  \"milestone_reference\": {\n    \"id\": \"<extracted_from_header_context.milestones_to_detail>\",\n    \"phase\": \"<extracted_from_master_plan>\",\n    \"dependencies\": \"<extracted_from_milestone_schema>\"\n  },\n  \"steps\": [\n    {\n      \"status\": \"[<derived from the style guide legend>]\",\n      \"component_label\": \"<derived_from_trd.components[]_context>\",\n      \"numbering\": \"<derived_from_milestone_position>\",\n      \"title\": \"<extracted_from_master_plan.milestone.title>\",\n      \"description\": \"<extracted_from_trd.technical_requirements>\",\n      \"inputs\": \"<extracted_from_milestone.acceptance_criteria>\",\n      \"outputs\": \"<derived_from_step_purpose>\",\n      \"validation\": \"<extracted_from_milestone_schema>\",\n      \"red_test\": \"<stateless test that proves the flaw or gap>\",\n      \"implementation\": \"<description of code required for red test to pass>\",\n      \"green_test\": \"<rerun red_test to prove it passes>\",\n      \"refactor\": \"<analyse against SRP, DRY, consider if the produced code can be simplified or extracted to a separate function>\",\n      \"commit_message\": \"<derive a rational message using the examples in style_guide>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"generation_limits\": {\n    \"max_steps\": 200,\n    \"target_steps\": \"120-180\",\n    \"max_output_lines\": \"600-800\"\n  }\n}"
}

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
