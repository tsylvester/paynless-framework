Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext, your generation must align with all of the other documents described in the HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document. 
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

In this turn you are building an actionable checklist for the user's objective. The `milestone_schema` provides sketch-level nodes for the work ahead. Your job is to take those sketch-level nodes and expand each one into a full file-level TDD cycle, producing a high-fidelity implementation checklist.

For each milestone node, produce a top-level checklist entry: * `[ ] [component_label] [path]/[function] **Title**` followed by every sub-item from the skeleton using the legend provided in your style guide. Each node equals one source file's entire TDD cycle. Nodes are dependency-ordered with lowest dependencies first so that the application can be tested and built at every completed node. If the milestone_schema node's deps list a provider, verify that provider has a corresponding node earlier in the checklist or is already completed. Your output must be structurally indistinguishable from the format in the style guide and contain every sub-item from the skeleton, fully explained to a level of detail any developer can implement without referring to resources beyond that specific node. Over-explaining is better than summarizing to eliminate ambiguity and ensure the developer can build the exact application described in the technical_requirements and other inputs you are receiving. 

Replace the placeholder value for each key of the JSON object below with fully written Markdown content derived from and informed by the HeaderContext plus the TRD, Master Plan, Milestone Schema, and any prior implementation artifacts. Each field should contain the markdown content for that section (paragraphs, bullet lists, etc.). For `milestone_ids` and `index`, populate the arrays with strings. For `nodes`, populate the array with fully developed node objects adhering to the node skeleton structure. For `milestone_reference`, populate the object with the milestone details. Align all implementation steps with the milestone requirements and TDD methodology. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much content as required to satisfy the HeaderContext: 

{"content":{"milestone_ids":["List the next milestone(s) to detail from the master_plan and milestone_schema as specified in the HeaderContext."],"index":["List the milestone(s) resolved in this section."],"milestone_reference":{"id":"Extracted from header_context.milestones_to_detail","phase":"Extracted from master_plan","dependencies":"Extracted from milestone_schema"},"nodes":[{"path":"Derived from file path","title":"Derived from file function","objective":["Explain the functional and non-functional requirements"],"role":["Explain the role this module will play"],"module":["Provide boundaries for the context or feature area"],"deps":["List each dependency with provider, layer, direction, and context slice"],"context_slice":["Define minimal surface required from each dependency"],"interface":["Detail all interfaces"],"interface_tests":["Detail contracts of each type and interface"],"interface_guards":["Each guard guarantees the contracts"],"unit_tests":["Tests that prove signature, return, and parameter contracts"],"construction":["Define canonical constructor or factory entrypoints"],"source":["Implementation of requirements"],"provides":["Bounded outer surface of the module"],"mocks":["Intercept all internal and external I/O"],"integration_tests":["Tests for interactions with providers and consumers"],"directionality":["Declare node layer and confirm dependencies are inward-facing"],"requirements":["Detail functional obligations and acceptance criteria"],"commit":["Detail each change performed on the file"]}],"milestone_summary":"Explain the desired outcome of this milestone, providing a concise synopsis of the milestone's purpose, scope, and key insights derived from the HeaderContext."}}

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced with actual content. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
