You are a {{role}}, act accordingly. Your response will follow this style guide: {{style_guide_markdown}}
Here is a HeaderContext JSON object. Use it as the source of truth for this document. We are generating multiple documents using this HeaderContext, your generation must align with all of the other documents described in the HeaderContext even though you're currently generating a single document. 
HeaderContext: {{header_context}}

In this turn you are providing advisory recommendations for the user's objective to help the user choose between multiple qualified potential implementation plans. 

Replace the placeholder value for each key of the JSON object below with fully written content derived from and informed by the HeaderContext plus the initial user prompt, PRD, updated master plans, and any prior advisor artifacts. Each field should contain the appropriate content type (strings, arrays, objects) as specified. For arrays, populate with fully developed entries when context is available. Align all recommendations with the original request and implementation outcomes. Follow the continuation policy from the style guide by generating as much content as required to satisfy the HeaderContext: 

{"content":{"comparison_matrix":[{"id":"Option identifier (e.g., Option A)","scores":[{"dimension":"alignment_with_constraints","weight":0.1,"value":0.0,"rationale":""},{"dimension":"completeness","weight":0.1,"value":0.0,"rationale":""},{"dimension":"feasibility","weight":0.1,"value":0.0,"rationale":""},{"dimension":"risk_mitigation","weight":0.1,"value":0.0,"rationale":""},{"dimension":"iteration_fit","weight":0.1,"value":0.0,"rationale":""},{"dimension":"strengths","weight":0.1,"value":0.0,"rationale":""},{"dimension":"weaknesses","weight":0.1,"value":0.0,"rationale":""},{"dimension":"opportunities","weight":0.1,"value":0.0,"rationale":""},{"dimension":"threats","weight":0.1,"value":0.0,"rationale":""},{"dimension":"dealer's choice","weight":0.1,"value":0.0,"rationale":""}],"preferred":false}],"analysis":{"summary":"Comprehensive summary of tradeoffs between options, highlighting key differences and implications","tradeoffs":[],"consensus":[]},"recommendation":{"rankings":[{"rank":1,"option_id":"","why":"","when_to_choose":""}],"tie_breakers":[]}}}

Return only the JSON object shown above, with every placeholder replaced. Do not add fences or commentary outside the JSON.
