- Review: The agents critique each other's work, finding flaws and blind spots.
- Refine: The best ideas are merged into a unified, superior plan.
- Plan: Agents transform plans into a project roadmap that explains exactly how to build your project.
- Implement: The agents expand roadmaps into a step-by-step implementation that's impossible to mess up.
