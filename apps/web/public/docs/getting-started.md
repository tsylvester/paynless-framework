# Welcome

Welcome to the Paynless Framework! This guide will help you get started with using our platform.

## How It Works

1. Submit Your Vision: Start a new Project with a simple problem statement. Use text input, or upload a markdown file. Explain what you want to build, and our AI team gets to work.

2. Pick Your Players: Use any AI model in our library, as many as you want. (We recommend 3.)

3. AI-Powered Dialectic:

- Thesis (Idea): Multiple AIs generate unique, diverse approaches.
- Antithesis (Critique): The AIs critique each other's work, finding flaws and blind spots.
- Synthesis (Merge): The best ideas are merged into a unified, superior plan.
- Parenthesis (Formalize): The AIs transform the plan into a detailed, actionable checklist of explicit, specific prompts that explain exactly how to perform each step.
Paralysis (Organize): The AIs organize the plan into a structured, easy-to-follow plan that's impossible to mess up.

4. Generate Key Documents: We generate Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), use cases, business cases, and a full, detailed implementation plan suitable for any developer.
- Features & What's Next
- Our implementation plans are a structured checklist of prompts that can be fed into a coding agent, or implemented manually by a team of developers.

We support individuals and organizations with powerful tools, including an innovative context-managed multi-user AI Chat and our groundbreaking structured Dialectic process.

Chat with coworkers about your project, pull an AI model into the chat for its opinion, and transition seamlessly into an implementation plan that explains exactly how to build the feature.

Coming Soon:
We're constantly rolling out new capabilities. Get ready for direct plan exporting to GitHub and a powerful CLI to sync your projects with Linear, Jira, Microsoft Project, and your other favorite tools.
We're working on importing plan documents into the dialectic so that your agents know exactly what to build.
