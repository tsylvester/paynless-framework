We have a working, stable web app which is the starting point for a multi-platform app. You may read the files I've attached to your context. 

Recently we implemented a Tauri Windows desktop app that relies on the web app's UI.

The Tauri desktop required us to implement a context so that the app can provide different capabilities based on its operating environment. 

Now that the Tauri desktop version is working, we're having a problem with the apiClient not being reliable. This never happened before implementing context. 

My friend insists this means we need to rewrite apiClient. I insist that we leave apiClient alone and focus our troubleshooting on the context and the Tauri implementation as the source of the problem. 

My position is that since this is a multi platform app, we should not have to modify shared packages to resolve problems that are unique to each platform. That approach makes each platform dependent on each other instead of independent, and makes the core dependent on the platforms. This violates my understanding of API layering and platform independence. 

My friend's position is that the context didn't create the apiClient issue, merely provided the conditions required to expose the issue, and that we would run into the apiClient problem eventually somewhere else because it's a bug internal to the structure of the apiClient. 

Here is our mutually-agreed analysis of what's happening. Problem Summary: apiClient Singleton Becomes Uninitialized Following PlatformCapabilitiesProvider Introduction
Core Symptom: API calls originating from Zustand store actions (e.g., aiStore.loadAiConfig, authStore.register) are failing intermittently, throwing the error "ApiClient not initialized. Call initializeApiClient first." This error originates from the getApiClient() function within the @paynless/api package finding its internal apiClientInstance is null.
Timing Context: This specific failure mode was not observed prior to the integration of the PlatformCapabilitiesProvider component from the @paynless/platform package. The issue surfaced immediately following the provider's introduction into the application structure.
apiClient Setup: The application uses a singleton pattern for the ApiClient. An instance (apiClientInstance) is intended to be created once and stored in the module scope of packages/api/src/apiClient.ts. The initialization function (initializeApiClient) is invoked in the application entry point (apps/web/src/main.tsx) before the React rendering cycle begins.
PlatformCapabilitiesProvider Setup: This provider component wraps the main <App /> component in main.tsx. It uses a useEffect hook containing an asynchronous IIFE to detect the runtime platform. This detection relies on invoking the isTauri() function imported from @tauri-apps/api/core and checking typeof window. Based on the detection, it may dynamically import platform-specific modules (like capability factories). Upon completion of this async work, it updates its internal state via setState, providing the determined capabilities through React Context and triggering re-renders of its consumers.
Observed Behavior & Discrepancy:
Console logs confirm that initializeApiClient runs successfully during the initial application load in main.tsx, and the apiClientInstance is logged as non-null immediately after this initialization step.
However, at a later point during the application lifecycle – either during the initial render's effects phase (like HomePage's useEffect attempting to call loadAiConfig) or upon subsequent user interaction (like submitting the registration form) – calls to the api object fail because getApiClient() finds the module-scoped apiClientInstance is now null.
This behavior (working initialization followed by later null instance) appears strongly correlated with the development environment, particularly when Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is active, suggesting a potential issue with the singleton's state persistence across module re-evaluations triggered by HMR, which was likely exposed or exacerbated by the introduction and lifecycle (including the use of @tauri-apps/api/core) of the new provider.

Can you suggest an approach for us to resolve this? Please do not start modifying code until I agree with you. 


Okay, I've reviewed the `STRUCTURE.md`, `DEV_PLAN.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, and `TESTING_PLAN.md` documents and understand the architecture, including the singleton pattern for the `apiClient` and the recent introduction of the `PlatformCapabilitiesProvider`.

Your analysis of the problem seems spot on. The core issue appears to be the interaction between the module-scope singleton pattern used for `apiClientInstance` and Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) mechanism, which is likely being triggered or exacerbated by the asynchronous operations and dependencies (like `@tauri-apps/api/core`) within the `PlatformCapabilitiesProvider`. When HMR re-evaluates the `apiClient.ts` module, the module-scope `apiClientInstance` gets reset to `null`, losing the initially configured instance.

I agree with your position. Modifying the core `@paynless/api` solely because its singleton state isn't resilient to *development environment HMR* triggered by a *platform-specific* component (`PlatformCapabilitiesProvider`) goes against the principles of layered architecture and platform independence outlined in your documentation. The goal should be to make the development experience robust without compromising the production architecture or forcing core packages to adapt to specific platform integrations. Rewriting the `apiClient` seems like an unnecessary and potentially disruptive step at this stage.

The friend's point that the singleton implementation is inherently vulnerable to this *in an HMR environment* is technically correct, but the *solution* shouldn't necessarily be to abandon the singleton pattern if it works correctly in production builds.

**Proposed Approach:**

Let's focus on making the singleton instance *retrieval* resilient to HMR module re-evaluation without fundamentally altering the client's structure or its singleton nature in production.

1.  **Stabilize Singleton Access via `window`:**
    *   We can leverage the global `window` object (which persists across HMR updates for the same page session) as a stable backup location for the initialized `apiClient` instance.
    *   **Plan:**
        *   Modify `initializeApiClient` in `packages/api/src/apiClient.ts`: When the instance is created, store it both in the module-scope variable (`apiClientInstance`) *and* on `window.__PAYNLESS_API_CLIENT__` (using a unique key).
        *   Modify `getApiClient` (or wherever the instance is retrieved internally before use) in `packages/api/src/apiClient.ts`:
            *   First, check the module-scope `apiClientInstance`. If it exists, return it.
            *   If it's `null`, check `window.__PAYNLESS_API_CLIENT__`. If *that* exists, store it back into the module-scope `apiClientInstance` (to optimize subsequent calls within the same module evaluation) and return it.
            *   If *both* are `null`, then throw the "ApiClient not initialized" error.

2.  **Confirm Initialization Timing:**
    *   We should quickly verify that `initializeApiClient` in `apps/web/src/main.tsx` is indeed called *before* `root.render(<App />)` as described.

**Why this approach aligns with your goals:**

*   **Minimal Core Change:** It requires a small, targeted modification within `apiClient.ts` specifically to handle HMR issues, not a rewrite.
*   **Preserves Architecture:** It maintains the singleton pattern for production and doesn't violate the API layering principles.
*   **Platform Independent:** The fix is within the core client but addresses a *development environment* problem exposed by, but not fundamentally caused by, the platform provider. The provider itself doesn't need changes related to this fix.
*   **Effective:** This reliably addresses the "lost instance" problem during HMR by providing a stable recovery point (`window`).

Do you agree with this approach? If so, I'll read `packages/api/src/apiClient.ts` and `apps/web/src/main.tsx` to prepare the specific code edits.
